It gets a bit steep at the top but it is well worth the effort. No guide needed but I met a couple of people who were keen to accompany me.It's a fascinating walk through the tropical rain forest.","It was quite an adventure for us even though its suitable for all levels of hikers to climb the mountain.The route we took requires alot of strength and effort to climb up the steep slopes as we approach the summit.Overall the view at the radio tower summit was nice however facilities such as toilets are only avaliable to the foot of the mountain.  ","Those who are at Gunung Lambak will see rare rooster. These roosters are very shy. Only lucky guys will see them around.","Was here with the family (all adults). Getting there by Googlemap needs input as \"Gunung Lambak Trailhead\". It is next to the Gunung Lambak resort which seems not to be functioning as a resort anymore but people still use the outdoors for exercise, etc. We were there about 8 am but there were already alot of people, which made identifying the trail head easy; met a number of friendly (mainly elderly) people. The trail we took to go up was quite tough for the not so young but fortunately it took about half an hour to cover about 900 m to a junction from whence we chose to head downwards; this latter path was much easier to negotiate and ended at the resort.","Went to Gunung Lambak earlier this year for a hike with my family. It took us about 3-4 hours to get up and another 2-3 hours to descend, albeit at a leisurely pace. Suitable for beginners who want to get a taste of hiking!","With a high of 510m, Gunung Lambak is a moderate hiking trail for hikers. The trail about 1.6km to reach the peak. There are many route & trail that you can choose to hike. The 1st trail is more challenging but it will save more time & the trail is more shorter, for fit hikers it will takes 1 hours to reach the top. However, 2nd trail is more easy & relax but the route are more longer. It will take 1 hours & 20 minutes for fit hikers to reach top if takes the 2nd route. Watch out for monkeys, it will try to steal your food & belongings. At the top you will be amazed by the view & it is worth.","Have hiked many different trails so I really enjoyed the experience of hiking this mountain.  About midway up it became very steep so there were ropes on the side to use to keep your balance and help get through the harder areas.  Unfortunately the day we hiked there was no view because of the clouds so will just have to go back another time.  A popular place to hike as there is more than one way to get up the mountain and some paths are easier than others.  Not a switchback type of trail so you have to be ready for just going straight up the mountain.","This was my first visit to  Kluang   Johor and a friend brought me to scale the mountain near the town of Kluang.  We parked our car at the base of the mountain.  A short walk up the jungle trail led us to a rope bridge  which is about 5 m above the ground.  On the way we met some trekkers and a troop of monkeys.   There were a few small snakes and some squirrels running on the tree branches.    We came across a waterfall and in the morning many residents from Kluang  come here to enjoy the fresh air on the mountain.  Visitors are advised not to feed the monkeys and if provoked  the monkeys can be ferocious.     If you leave the monkeys alone, they will not bite you.    We saw a group of monkeys fighting and one of them was seriously injured.  It was bleeding at the shoulder and I think it may not survive for a week.    The air is cool and you can hear the noise of cicadas along the trail.","On the 17th Of March 2018, 6 of us took a drive from JB to Kluang and headed to the Gunung Lambak recreational forest to experience the awesomeness of the forest. We ascended to the mountain with much challenge and we all enjoyed the hike up which took us about an hour half to the peak. The natural flora and fauna here is untouched and appreciate that the hikers have done well by not littering and that top is well kept. Bravo to all who has made this place a great enjoyment for everyone visiting this place.

Once you start on the climbing trail, it's jungle trail all the way, no clear steps, lots of climbing with high steps and ropes. At the first clearing (where there is a shelter, a local shrine, a pond and a big sign welcoming you to Gunung Lambak), the trail splits. The left one is the steeper one that goes to the summit (the above trail description is for this trail), while the right one is gentler, goes to the 2nd summit and takes slightly longer. Most people go up the steeper left trail to the summit, then continue to the 2nd (lower) summit and come down by the right trail. Of course, you can also back track where you came from - going down is also quite tricky; not a place where you can run down. The trail can be muddy and slippery when it rains. Climbing is then not recommended as the ropes will also get slippery.To get to the park at the foot of the mountain, take a taxi - a 15-min ride from town, costing about RM12 one-way. Tell the driver to come back to pick you up after 3 to 4 hrs (be prepared to wait - when we were there earlier this month, the taxi driver was almost an hr late coming back to pick us up).","You can choose to go in the morning or evening.  You can choose to just walk up the hill or also continue to climb more. So, it's good for gathering. For age 3 and above","In September, I did the Tiger's Nest hike in Bhutan which required a walk up at an elevation of 900 m.  However the path there is much easier to handle than the track at Gunung Lambak.  After passing the restrooms near to the carpark, we took the straight route which involves  more climbing but it is more scenic. The easier route would be to turn left at the hanging bridge. The initial half of the walk to the resting area at half way point is lovely and of course there are many steps to climb.  When we reached there, we were told that there are again two paths to the top.  One is shorter but steeper.  We took the longer route but it still involves many challenging moments where we really depended alot on the ropes, vines, tree trunks and branches to aid in our climb.We persisted in our climb to reach the top and finally reached the top. There is a clear lovely view of the town from the top.  The height at the top is 510 m.  There is a hut with shelter at the top as well as monkeys.  Surprisingly, it was easier coming down.  Again we reached the half way point where we could wash our hands with the cool water from a tap there.  Continuing further on until we reached the signboard, we took the straight path which is the easier way to walk down instead of going down the same path we took coming up-thanks to the advice of some experienced trekkers.  We took about 3 hours 30 mins for the round trip. It was a satisfying hike.  We booked a driver from Johor Bahru for the day trip which includes the sights of Kluang and Johor Bahru from 7.30 am to 6 pm at M$600 in a car.  The drive to Kluang from Johor Bahru is about 1.5 hours.","First time to Kluang and hiking up this mountain was worth it.  Did get to see monkeys, squirrels and millipede while on the way up.  The pathway for the 1st half mountain was OK. You can take a break before climbing up the next path.The next path was quite a challenge for non hikers especially decending but there is ropes to assist . You will have a nice view at the peak. Suitable for children and old people too as I have seen many of them hiking up.  ","We reached Kluang around noon time and took a taxi to Gunang Lambak. We went the easier route up as there are 2 routes to chose. However, the easier route also need quite steep climbing at certain parts. It's good to bring a hiking pole to support and gloves as need to use ropes at certain parts to climb up. The view at the summit is not really good but I'm still glad to make it to the top. We had our lunch at the shelter with many surrounding monkeys eyeing our food. While descending, we went the wrong way and the path was really steep going down. My legs were wobbly after reach the bottom. Not really an easy hike for 1st timer as I got muscle pains after the climb. It's good to bring some clothes to change as one will gets very sweaty after the climb. While we were sitting there resting, a tree fell and blocked our path, lucky we still able to squeeze through. Don't use the softdrink vending machine near the water park, it's faulty.","We had a memorable day at Gunung Lambak. We started early and reached the midpoint easily, meeting a group of schoolgirls on tour and finding our first cache of the day. Then things got more complicated as we missed a turn on our way to the summit. We ended up climbing a river bed, or rather a torrent path, to the top, arriving all sweaty and stained at the second cache. The way down was still quite steep and after finding out third cache we gave up on the last one. But overall, we spent a very nice day on the `mountain‚Äô.","It was a fun hike for my family. We are from the age range from 7 to 67. My 3 kids are 1st timer and we all manage to complete in 2.5 hrs ","You can walk up and down within a few hours.  The track is quite steep in parts towards the summit.  There are ropes to help you up or down.","Imagine hiking up this 500m+ mountain and be welcomed by a blanket of mist at the 300m checkpoint? Nature at its best. So fortunate to experience it.","I visited Gunung Lambak and UK Farm recently with my family. We booked our stay at guest house in Kluang using AirBnB.It was a very good experience away from hussle bustle of city. Hiking track is scenic. Kids really enjoyed the whole stay . I definitely recommend people to mist try this place.Just to set the expectation, there is roughly 5 KM track without proper road to reach UK Farm. Have to drive car bit slow.

We got there slightly after noon on a sunny day.   Thankfully there are plenty of trees provided enough shades from the sun.  There is a stream flowing from top of the mountain down to the ground level. The waters are very cool, clear & we met quite a few locals collecting natural water for consumption. There are two paths going up to the mid hill.  An easier gravel pathways through the hanging bridge, which you can walk up without any sticks or helps. The downside is you will miss the stream & the better view, and will be surrounded by trees. The more challenging path is along the stream, but it soon pass through more difficult terrain with ropes installed. There was a resting areas at mid hill and took us about 40 mins to get there.  Then it get harder & harder, and we have to turn back with another 200 ft to the top (probably another 10, 15 mins to go) since my son was wearing slippers and it get really dangerous & slipper.It was quite a pleasant hike overall, but be prepared for proper hiking shoes & sticks, drinking waters & a towel & clean set of clothes for shower & change.","The best place if you want to hiking or having picnic with your family or friends.

No entry fees, clearly marked trails, lot of hikers on the route. Can finish it in a half day. But can do a relax one in a day. Can try different route for descend.","An excellent place to spend a morning at, Gunung Lambak is a pleasant hike that will allow you to sweat it out while enjoying the greens in Kluang.","Gunung Lambak is very near the town of Kluang, a couple of hours by bus from Singapore. Wikipedia had earlier informed me that it is not very high for a mountain. But, as I stood at the base looking up at the summit about 500 metres above me, I suddenly realized that ‚Äì maybe ‚Äì Wikipedia and I have very different CONCEPTS OF SCALE!Gulp!I am sure there are others who can better detail the finer points of Gunung Lambak. They would probably describe the way the sunlight threw dappled patterns on the leaf-strewn pathways, or the tree branches and roots that had twisted into complex shapes, or maybe even the fascinating line-up of small insects that they met along the way.To me, however, it was nature‚Äôs own torture chamber. As I clawed/crawled/slid my way up, I would be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt tempted to find a shady spot and just stay there forever. I didn‚Äôt think I had it in me to move an inch forward. But, thanks to my group of 42 other hiker's encouragement whom I'm glad to call all of them my new amazing friends, I did finally make it to the top. Yaaa‚Ä¶ouch‚Ä¶yay!Jelly legs. Aching arms. Dirt on my face. Dead leaves in my hair. My t-shirt soaked with sweat.*Not exactly the picture of a conquering hero*But, would I do this again?

Sadly, it was far better the condition with free flow natural stream to cool us off after a short hike to the mountain.  My recent visit saw the valley had turned dry with man made theme park that was not well maintained or due to entrance charges and to observe its operating hours, there was more monkeys than visitors at the premise.  Another common scene in malaysia.  Althoughthe track was still available for hiking, the thrill as a nature outing was hardly felt.","you can listen to beautiful birds, see a few monkeys and enjoy the amazing natureI was there for more than 3 hours and I saw not more than 4 people, its such a quiet place","Went for a leisure hike at Gunung Lambak on Sunday, 16 October '16. No intention to reach the summit (would take about 4-5 hours up and down; physically challenging; and it requires some fitness level preparation).We went to the mid-way point (800m mark). The tracks were broad, easy to walk, gradient was comfortable, and a good pair of walking shoes will do. Enjoy the fresh crisp mountain air. Explore a mini waterfall and stream on your return leg. As it was a weekend, expect to meet many friendly locals climbing the mountain for exercise. The mountain track can be accessible by cross country bicycles.Google map and trip advisor map is not update on the location. We were brought to a dead end cul-de-sac road of terrace houses. Luckily got us we met a middle age man who was walking his dog. After making enquiries, he knew that we were not sure of the way to the Gunung Lambak Recreation Park. Know what? He decided to ride on his motorcycle and led us all thr way to the park. According to the gentleman, many people have been led by their GPS to the wrong location. Can Google and Trip Advisor please update the destination point to Gunung Lambak as shown in my screenshot? The correct address to the foothills starting point for your trekking is going via:Jalan Kampung Majid (see screenshot of GPS map of location).","Great place to train the legs for longer treks.

More for relaxing in the resorts and the new waterparks.Most important is transport. There are no grabs here. Taxis you wont see and need to call them to come. Taxi rates will be very high. So remember to get your transportation settled if you are not driving. I will recommend 3D2N at most.

We don't have much time to have a walk there maybe on next visit. But one thing here it seems like people didn't abide to laws written on the board near the beach which is one of them \"pets are not allowed\" but we saw people still bring them to the beach. :P Seems like nobody's taking care of that and maintaining cleanliness since lots of rubbish and bringing animals/pets is a no since this a public beach and they could leave \"something\" behind if you know what I mean and that's not good for other people and for this beach itself. There seems to be other part that have been taken by rich people for \"development\" as its pathway to it is blocked and I hope they don't affect the beach.

There is also no time restriction on this ticket it can be used anytime on the date the ticket has on it.Waited about 10mins and shared the gondola with 5 others on the first section , 2 others on the second section to the top and had the gondola to myself on the way back down. Don‚Äôt book the glass bottom gondola for an exceptional view through the glass on the floor as the glass is scratched due to shoes, fogs up if very humid and with 6 passengers you are looking past other people‚Äôs legs and feet and hand luggage.Views over the tree canopy and a waterfall or two if they are flowing can be seen through the windows of the gondola.Upon reaching the top for a small additional cost you can visit the sky bridge by either walking down and then back up again along a track or use the funicular at a cost.As others have mentioned the wait for the funicular can be lengthy, so walking may be the best option.The Skybridge gives some impressive views over smaller islands and back towards the Pantai Cenang and over tree canopy to the ocean. It also has three glass panels that you can stand on (shoes must be taken off to avoid scratching the glass) Make sure you only go when the weather is good otherwise you may see little of the view and the Skybridge is also closed during strong winds.A few eateries available at the top including an ice cream vendor and toilets with the main food areas around the area where you buy your tickets.The garden and park area as you enter before walking up to the ticket area was poorly maintained and in need of some maintenance.If you don‚Äôt have your own transport best way to get there is a fixed price cab and when it‚Äôs time to return a cab area is located just outside in the same area where you got dropped off.Definitely worth a visit, the amount of time you spend there will depend on the queues, the weather and your own interest in taking in the views.","Great morning here, fab views from the top too. Paid a little extra for express lane and a glass bottomCabin, which was definitely worth it as we had it to ourselves. In some of the non express & non special cabins visitors were being pretty packed in! Would recommend.","Looks like a theme park. The ticket to the skycab takes you up two levels. Get off at the first one to go to the viewing playforms for some great photos then back on again to the next level. The skybridge costs extra but not much. Plenty of places to eat. Toilets cost 1 ringit - try to have small bills cos that helps. ","Amazing view and experience. Reach there in the evening when it is less crowded but most of the places will.shut down after 6 pm.","The view from the top of Skylab is spectacular, however the cable car ride is interrupted halfway to make you wait for hours under the relentless sun.

The SkyBridge offers an adrenaline-pumping experience as it stretches across the mountain peaks, providing visitors with jaw-dropping views of the surroundings. The engineering marvel of the bridge adds an extra layer of excitement to the SkyCab experience.","Great to do, lovely views! Goes as following.Buy a ticket online at the SkyCab website directly. It wasn‚Äôt possible at the time to buy a Cab only ticket, only a package which cost ‚Ç¨17 pp. If you want to arrive after 10/1030 ‚Äòinvest‚Äô in a fast lane ticket (extra ‚Ç¨10 pp) as well. Get a Grab to the Oriental Village, then a small 5/10 min walk through a ‚Äòpark‚Äô with shops, toilets, ATM and restaurants. Queue 1 for pick up tickets (even if you bought them online or go to counter 6), queue 2 to enter Cab waiting line, then of course the Cab waiting line itself. Here your fast lane ticket comes in handy. With the cableway go to the middle station for a view. Then enter another queue (with fast lane option) for second cable way part. When getting off immediately buy your ticket for the bridge on the left (‚Ç¨3, maybe need to wait in line again). Option to go with the elevator or by stairs. If you are in normal condition; choose the stairs +/- 300 steps (10min). Saves you a queue (without fast lane option) and the elevator is n√≥t spectacular. The bridge is really cool. Much bigger, wider and steadier than for example Curtis Crest treetop (Penang) but so much higher and great views! Glass floor plates nice final touch. Then back in the queue again if you choose the elevator, and then again for the cableway to go down. This only took us 5 min. To be fair, we went on a Friday during school holidays, arrived at 930 and the longest wait was for the elevator to go to the bridge and back. But when we left around 12/1230 it was chaos! So come early and/or outside school holidays. Great attraction either way!","2 hour wait despite pre booking tickets. That‚Äôs after a 30 minute wait to collect tickets. Not much more to say to get over 100 characters","I've been here since 10am and I've queued and queued and I still haven't even got to the end of the line to ascend in the cable car? Arrive early, they said!","Gondolas were clean.  Views were beautiful as you ascend Mt. Machinchang to the middle station.  You even get a glimpse of Seven Wells Waterfall.  Get off at the middle station for awesome views of the mainland & surrounding islands.  At the top station enjoy the views & landscape as wander across the sky bridge & stand on the clear glass flooring, look down below to appreciate just how high up you have traveled.  The Skyglide, not so exciting.  Basically it‚Äôs a one track singular funicular that holds approx. 10 people at a time.  You will need a seperate ticket to ride the Skyglide or better still for free you can walk leisurely down along the nature trail & back up again.  No waiting in the small cramped area, lining up in the heat, sun or other weather conditions the tropics experience.","The views are amazing and this is definitely worth a visit.Frightening heights but incredible at the same time!","Allegedly the steepest cable car in the world and boy is it steep! Fabulous views, really well organised and a good all round experience","Stunning views and lovely experience. Simply a must do in Langkawi. The cable car is a great ride and we used the skyglide too although there are long queues for this as there is only 1 cabin, easier to walk to the skybridge if you can.

","We didn't get to see the complete panorama of Langkawi because it was cloudy when we got to the top of the mountain. However, the views from the top were fantastic. A wonderful adventure with breathtaking vistas of Langkawi. We were given expedited tickets. The skyglide up to the bridge was the only thing that required our attention as we waited.

We took glass flooring gondola. The glass is not really clear anymore for us to see thru below but we get to go on express lane. Amazing view. Lots of staff to manage the queue. Totally recommend this ride. ","Visiting the Skybridge was at the top of my \"things to do\" list while visiting Langkawi. I took Grab there from my hotel.  It was about a 30-minute ride.It was about a 15-minute walk through the village to get to the entrance. There were no lines.  I bought my ticket, and within minutes,  I was in a gondola up to the top.I want to note that the Skycab ride payment is only for the Skycab.   Once you get to the top, you have to pay another fee to get to the Skybridge. I mistakenly got off at mid-station.   I took some pictures of the views and got back on to the top.I thought it was going yo be a short walk to the Skybridge.   But later found out you have to pay a separate fee to go down to the Skybridge in either a funicular,  which they call a Skyglide,  or walk down 334 steps.  I chose to walk.  It was a nice walk in the rainforest.  It was cool because it had been raining lightly. The Skybridge was great, and the views were magnificent. I highly recommend this activity. There is a lot of walking involved once you get to the top.","The cable car itself was good with nice views however the activities that one can do other than take pictures are almost none. It‚Äôs good to visit once but never again","The sky cab was broken for 2 days when we went. The website was not updated with this info. It stayed open from 12 from 18-23 Oct and when we got there they said 12. Then the tannoy person said delays so starts at 1pm. Then at 1:30 pm the message was 2. We asked for a refund and they were only going to give us a refund for the sky cab. If you pay the full 80rm this covers 4 attractions which on purchase they say to get. What they don‚Äôt say is the sky cab is only 25-30. We spent 3 hours waiting and in the end walked about having seen only the 3D exhibition which is fun.","We enjoyed our visit to the sky bridge despite the changing weather from clear skies to overcast and misty. The ascent / descent in the cable car is rapid and offers fantastic panoramic views of the surrounding areas. With good visibility you can see for kilometres / miles around. The sky bridge may not be for those of a nervous disposition or fear of heights but we would recommend giving it a go. Our visit entailed taking the cable car to the main stopping point, then walking down the many steps to the sky bridge to beat the queue for the furnicular rail car. Having spent time in the bridge enjoying the views we did take the rail car back up. From there we took the steps up to the other vantage points but by then the clouds had closed in. Regardless of this we enjoyed the experience.We couldn‚Äôt see any advantage in paying for the VIP experience. As there were only two of us we found that we got called forward to fill places in a cable car to ensure they were full (they seated six).","Great view from the top.  Didn‚Äôt do the skybridge as scared of heights so ride to the top was enough.  There is also a village of shops and restaurants.","Panorama Langkawi is one part out of four while visiting this place. Cable car or Telefrek 2 ways with a junction stop at the middle. You can continue to the SkyWalk on feet or use elevator for extra charges. The first part will let you see beautiful Langkawi from the top. Many beautiful trees, faunas and monkeys. Don‚Äôt forget to take a picture with the head of the eagle. Continue walk is not easy for elders and children. The steps are not even and a bit risky.","What seemed like a great experience was a bit disappointing. We paid for the skycab, went up, but then suddenly the skybridge was closed. Would have understood this if there was a lot of wind, but there wasn t any wind, just foggy. Going over the skybridge while it was foggy would still have been a nice experience in my opinion.  Could have been an amazing experience, even in the fog.","There is a reason this is the number one Thing to Do in Langkawi. The Sky cab sits high up above the mountains on the north west side of the island was was very close to our hotel. We pre-booked and selected the new 360 sky cable cars,, which effectively meant we had the cable car to ourselves the entire time as it seemed few others booked them. Thankfully, it didn‚Äôt rain so we were able to take in the stunning views. It was very busy during our trip and it was wonderful to see that it was a spot for both local and international tourists. We had a good walk round, taking too many selfies. Do not miss the 3D art gallery as that was awesome. We didn‚Äôt go on the bridge or sky glide as the queues were rather long and we didn‚Äôt fancy a long walk - the rain was also threatening at this point - but if you can, don‚Äôt miss these.","We were very unlucky as it was a cloudy day when we went. So, we could not see the lovely scenery of Langkawi from the top. But, still overall, me and my family enjoyed to some extent.We bought our tickets on Klook - which was a combined one for glass gondola + Sky Glide (funicular lift) + Express Lane + Sky Bridge for RM 120 each. The Express Lane was very worth it because we saw a huge line for ordinary lane and an absolutely empty Express Lane. We could wiz through. Also, every time you have to take the gondola to go up and come down, you are given preference because of the Express Lane. So, I will definitely recommend that.We took the Glass Gondola which was not very impressive. The glass floor was not very clear. So, I would recommend taking an ordinary gondola. Also, the glass gondola takes a lot of time to come so you have to keep waiting. So, the Express Lane ticket then becomes a waste. So, take ordinary gondola, but opt for Express Lane. I think that's the best combination.There is a mid station which we were not aware about which is pretty useless. So, if you have less time, then you can avoid getting down at the mid station and continue your journey to the higher and last station.At the last station is where you get down and go to the remarkable Sky Bridge. You can either go by stairs or take the Sky Glide which is a funicular elevator. There is a short queue for that as the elevator takes in about 10 people at a time. If there is a huge rush then the waiting time here could be much longer. But, still it is worth it to take the funicular because of the novelty of it and the lovely view you get from there. While going to the Sky Bridge, the funicular goes down and when you come back it goes up. Also, a tip for a nice video. When the funicular goes up stand in the front side and take a video as it moves up. This will be a nice video of the track and the beautiful surrounding as you go up.At the Sky Bridge it was a disappointment because it was all very cloudy and misty and we could not see anything from there. However, since we went on the Malaysia Independence Day weekend, the Sky Bridge was beautifully decorated with many Malaysia flags. It is a nice back drop for a photograph as you stand on the bridge.After we came back up from the Sky Bridge to the last station, I related to my family about the fact that Shah Rukh Khan's Don movie was shot there - the climax scene between him and Boman Irani. We actually found the platform where it was shot and clicked a photograph there!There is also a bridge where people in love put up locks. There are thousands of locks there and again makes a beautiful back drop for a picture. There is a cafe and an ice cream parlour. We enjoyed hot corn and ice cream there before we made our way back down the gondola. The entrance to the Sky Cab is through a shopping centre called Oriental Village. It is quite pretty with lots of garment shops + eateries. My wife and my daughter bought very nice linen pyjamas there. Overall, we spent around 1.5 hours there. My most important tip would be to check the weather. If it is cloudy then wait for it to clear up. The best part is to see the view from top.

Yes that's right, not just a cluster, but a collection of clusters. The typical photo is just the highest falls. Below it, is a cascading cluster of many pools at various levels, with smooth streaming water channels from one to another. Many of these channels are on bare rock, smoothened over many millenia of flowing water, that you can slide from one pool to the next just like a water-themepark ride. Not just one, but a series of them. This mountain range is 550million years old.If you have all day, after playing at the lower falls, or even before, climb up the hiking trail staircase to the upper falls. The area above this tall falls in the typical photos, has a spacious picnic area, and an even bigger open space with even more terraced pools of even longer cascading waterslides. You just cannot finish this themepark in a day. I had to go back another day to enjoy it again!","Kept extremely clean. Maintenance team is constantly working, very nice to see. Not a difficult trip to the waterfall as there were steps.

We were a bit late to start the walk to the summit. This gives us a reason to come back here.At the bottom, we had a coconut drink at the stall.

There is a lot of stairs to climb up but once you reach the peak it really worth it.

While still having fun with their customers, they were very safety conscious at all times, I can't recommend this strongly enough.","Telaga Tujuh Waterfalls aka Seven Wells Waterfall turned out to be a bit of a damp squib for me. I loved the challenge of the climb up. It‚Äôs a good test of stamina in hot and humid conditions. When I got to the top, there‚Äôs hardly anything to see. It‚Äôs dry season and there wasn‚Äôt much water except where it had collected in the rock pools (I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs the seven wells), where people were swimming and sliding around.If you‚Äôre planning to dip in the pools, then by all means make the climb. If you want to see a spectacular waterfall, don‚Äôt do it in dry season like I did, there won‚Äôt be much to see. That includes the waterfall viewing area further down. That was just a drizzle of water falling over the cliff.","Very scenic swinging through the tree tops.Great fun , very friendly staff with a sense of humour Excellent safety standards with modern equipmentExtra cost for photos (over 100) but well worth itHighly recommended","After a hiking route from the village, not easy because it is not trivialized.

It was not overrun. Also clean. Just make sure to watch your steps, when the stones get wet they are quite slippery. The view is also phenomenal. We could even see a whole monkey family cross the waterfalls, just a great place in the middle of the nature. Climbing up the stairs is exhausting especially in the heat but totally worth it. If you are capable to climb so many stairs do it, the seven wells on the upper level are way more beatiful than the ground level! Free entry and toilets also.","Popped here after the skycab.. it's just a few mins ride away.Walked up to the waterfall from the parking area which only took about 5 mins. It's uphill but very manageable and the walk mainly shaded. Got there midday, had some lunch at one of the stalls where we parked, lots of options for drinks, fresh coconuts etc.Free toilets both where the stalls are and an extra set right by the waterfall. Went there in dry season so the waterfall wasn't very big, but still looked pretty, plenty of water to paddle, pools to dip in and plenty of space to sit in the shade. Wasn't too crowded early afternoon on a Saturday.Didn't go up to the wells as I'd read somewhere that they've dried up atm so best just to stick to the waterfall. Can easily while away a couple of hours here relaxing in or out of the sun.","We hit this by mistake, we had time to Waste locally to The waterfall and decided to male the hike.. What a experience!!The hike up was painful.. It was 300meters according to the signs.. Felt like 25 miles in the heat and humidity and rain..Got to the top and  relaxed in the ice cold natural water... What a total pleasure. ","Until I arrived at the site, I was a bit scared for my first experience, however, my fear turned into fun immediately after the first flight, due to the kind and friendly staff with a lot of humour. I enjoyed the beautiful woods and mountains during the 12 flights. After 4th or 5th flight, I even found the birds and animals with releasing both hands away from the ropes!!It was one of the memorable trips in my life. I was fun!!","There are two options (or 3 if you include zipline). First is 200 steps to intermediate falls. In dry season just a few puddles. Then further 500 stairs to top & viewing platform. Few more pools, but not much water. You have to enjoy the tough walk up there if you're going to get value for your time. Probably great in wet season. Plenty of toilets & some shelter on the way.","It was one of the best things I've had done! Guide Sal made it more perfect! I felt safe, i had so fun and the most i had amazing experience! All staff are so friendly and everything is well organized!","We spent 2 to 3 hours there sitting by the natural small but refreshing pools. It was clean and not too crowded. Going down, we passed by the waterfall which was nice but didn't stay there for too long. There is no entrance fee, we just payed 1rm to park the scooter. ","I did go in the dry season so the falls themselves were not impressive but the pools of water were good. There was a lot of them, quite a large area but it also gets busy so you'll never have the place to yourself to relax properly.I think I passed a lot of people on the climb up, which is over 450 steps and was difficult for me, let alone older people. It could be better in the wet season if the water is flowing and maybe the rain would keep people away so you get more time to yourself to enjoy it, but I can't guarantee that for sure.","Bit of a waste of time. Hardly any water, so no great experience. Saw the rocks though !! We were advised before hand, so no complaint.","Nothing great. I have seen prettier waterfalls. Probably cos we didn't walk to the top. I just find that the area is not well maintained. Sad to say that Malaysia has many nice waterfalls and it is often spoilt by the lack of  upkeep.

The most i loved was eagle feeding and actual mangrove.  We were in awe with the mangroves and imagined the eco-system that thrived below it.  The eagle population resides in these mangroves along with the monkeys.  It was awsum to see the eagles swoop down to pick their food (chicken pieces) from the water. Another activity included was the fish farm where we met Farida the sting ray fish and Ali the tiger (?) fish.  The fish farm itself is a dingy place with compartments made in the sea for different kinds of fishes.  I was wondering the amount of food that was being fed to the sting ray with every tourist wanting to feed it ! But overall an excellent trip and worth doing it when in Langkawi. ","We booked with de Baron holidays and had a excellent day..we were picked up from our hotel and taken to our boat‚Ä¶ the travel time was around half an hour.We were met by our guide who did agreat job at getting everyone organised.The boat trip was wonderful,we were given safety life jackets to wear and even though we went into open sea water I felt very safe even though the boat was doing high speed in fact it felt quite exciting.The stops we made were interesting especially the eagle spotting,there were lots around and in fact for me I could have stayed longer just watching them.It was high tide so we could only look outside the crocodile cave,in low tide the boat goes through,we visited bat cave,be aware monkeys hang around the entrance to the pay desk and steal whatever they can.You stop at the fish farm for a basic lunch but you can order other dishes and pay for them yourself,the food provide was fried chicken and rice.The trip ended on a beach I have to say I did struggle to get off the boat ( I‚Äôm 70 years old) it was quite a drop down to the beach,it‚Äôs here where your return taxi waits for you,the whole day was very well organised and we thoroughly enjoyed it and thought great value .. we paid 100 each.","Kilim Geoforest and the Mangrove boat ride is must visit if you are coming to Langkawi. The boat pier is an easy access from all hotels in the town. Boat ride booking can be done online and payment can be done prior boarding the boat. Cash payment is preferred. A 3-hour boat ride costs RM300, but the experience you will have is once in a decade kind of. The ride and associated activities are suitable for age travelers. ","Simply a must do if you‚Äôre in Langkawi - it‚Äôs the best activity on the island. It‚Äôs around 90 ringgit for most of the stalls selling tickets, which includes full day with hotel pick up. The fish farm is cool, the eagle feeding is ethical (NB you don‚Äôt physically feed the eagles, you watch them feed in the river), and along the river we saw monkeys, lizards and snakes. All in all, a terrific experience.","Took the mangrove tour package by the official park manager of kilim geoforest park. Rented a whole boat for a 3-hour tour for RM450 (~USD100). Boat can accommodate 10 pax. Loved that we had the whole boat to ourselves. The tour guide was super helpful in answering our curiosities and took amazing photos. Visited bat cave, an underwater cave, eagle watching, photo sessions at the main geopark sign and beach swimming. There are also floating restaurants to enjoy lunch at the geopark. Early booking is required for dinner. Particularly enjoyed the spectacular view of the mangrove and hills throughout the tour.","We got a private boat for 2 of us for RM300 (2 hours). Our boat driver is also our guide and he is really informative.We visited the Bat cave and entrance fees were RM2 for adults and we rented the torchlight for RM1. There were so many bats and it was awesome.The mangroves were amazing and we saw crabs, the fish which can go on land, monkeys and eagles. Our boat driver did not feed the eagles as he explained that the eagles must not get used to eating food from tour boats. They learnt during the pandemic that when there were no tour boats, the eagles just kept waiting for food until they realized that they must hunt for their own food.At the fish farm, we saw stingrays and some other fishes in the tanks. We did not have lunch there.The boat then went out to the Andaman sea and we could see Thailand at a distance.

It is so incredibly non eco freindly that it should be closed down. The fish farm is not a farm but consists of numerous underwater cages with beautiful fish such as stingrays swimming in filthy water full of rubbish and plastic bottles. Their sole purpose is to entertain tourists and they are fed every time a tourist wanders by. The Eagle and Monkey feeding stations will have a significant negative effect on these wild populations and their behaviour. Once again for the sole reason of entertaining tourists.our trip involved a stay on an Island beach. This was covered in detritus and rubbish which no one had bothered to clear up and most tourists were standing around waiting to be picked up. The Malaysian authorities should realise that Nature is not be taken advantage of and monetised. They will kill off an attraction that they should be promoting.","We arrived at the park independently after our tour guide failed to turn up and it worked out very well for us!We booked the boat trip with just the eagles, the bat cave and the fish farm. The fish farm is not worth a stop, it's a bit sad and I would give it a miss if you can. The speedboat trip was great and watching the eagles feed was awesome.The bat cave was cool- pay the extra few pence for their torch to see the bats and watch out for the monkeys which are everywhere!Would recommend b ut as a do it yourself.","This was a 4 hour tour with a great guide. He spoke English and was knowledgable and focused on preservation. We visited the bat cave, was the eagle feeding grounds, monkeys on the beach and more. A pleasant half day on the water.","This is basically a Mangrove Tour on a speedboat with a number of activities to add on. The mangroves itself were beautiful and you get to see eagles, Brahmani Kites and long tailed macaques (monkeys). The Bat Cave is average with more tourists and monkeys sightings than actual bats. Ask you criss cross the sea there a number of 'created' tourist sights like Gorilla Mountain and Whale Island. The worst of the lot being floating fish farm. This is basically an enforced lunch. All boats stop at their designated fish farms. Either you buy lunch with your mangrove tour or you order there. As vegetarians we found nothing to eat. The fish farm tour is a mere formality showing you 5-6 types of fishes. If you take the longer tour then you go out towards the Andaman Sea from where you can see Thailand. We were lucky enough to spot several dolphins there and this was definitely the highlight of our tour. But I am told dolphins are not spotted as regularly. All in all the basic mangrove tour package will take about 2 hours and the one with the sea and fish farm tours about 4 hours. There is no point booking in advance as rates are fixed and on display at the pier. Boats go out on trips every half an hour so not a very long waiting time also.","Excellent boat tour of Killim Karst Geopark with JungleWalla. We saw crabs, bats, macaques, sea eagles, kites and lots of interesting fish. Our guide was knowledgeable and very friendly. And JungleWalla takes a proper approach towards ecotourism - eg not feeding the eagles and monkeys (as other operators do). If you are going to do a tour of this lovely and scenic mangrove area, I would recommend doing it with a reputable company like Jungle Walla.","We booked a half-day trip with Jungle Walla. Our guide was very knowledgeable and showed us lots of wildlife including birds, snakes, bats and crabs. The mangroves and islands are simply beautiful. Would love to do this trip again one day  :-)","When we visited cable car was closed for maintenance. Among rest Kilim Geoforest mangrove tour is superb.Much better views than we expected, simply gorgeous. Calm waters not choppy like when you do Island hopping. We took 2 hour tour which is good enough, bat cave was unique.We got good rate of 200 ringgit for whole boat for 2 of us.So message me for owner number, I got the boat owner direct number from one of Grab taxi guys whom Bro owned a boat at Kilim.A must visit I would say, well worth the trip.","The place has many to offer. We had an exciting boat tour to the bat cave (you have to pay an additional ticket), then visited the crocodile-shaped cave with lots of wild monkeys.  Be careful not to load too many snacks and fruits on the boat otherwise they will land on your boat and grab some of your food!  The eagle feeding was really amazing. Don't forget to video it and take a picture at the Kilim Karst wall. ","This is a trip that you should not miss in when you travel to Langkawi. There are various packages offered by various operators. They are of various durations. I will say that the 2 hours duration is the most optimum where you can cover the max.The majority of the operators start from the Kilim Geoforest jetty. This the better one from a pricing point of view.There is no need to pre-book as I found plenty of options.If you are in a group of 4-6, take a dedicated boat.The trip starts with a visit to the Bat cave. where you get  a small halt. Flash photography is not allowed. Please do respect that rule !It is very dark there and you can make out that the bats are hanging.The next stopover will be the floating fish-farms. I will say that this part of Okay. You get to see fishes, feed them and also hold some of the animals like the horse-shoe crabs, lobster etc. You can have a meal in the floating restaurant.  The price menu for lobster mentions in MYR/100 gm. A typical lobster will be weighing 400 gm or more. Just keep that in mind.The next leg is a eagle feeding . They take you to a place where the eagles come a get the food from the water. You will see White-belied eagles and Brahminy kites.The rest of the journey is  cruising along the mangroves in the motor boat.The Kids did enjoy this trip very much !","You can do many activities here!

However, the caves tour waste of time and not resourceful as nothing to sight especially the Bat Cave","Before I begin, I will say the staff and the boat driver were friendly.We went for the package C, eagle feeding was a good watch but I didn't like the idea they baited the water with chicken skin, there are many eagles anyway to watch without baiting.Feeding the monkeys, clearly you could see the monkeys didn't look that healthy in my opinion, kind of relied on human feeding, and the guy back at the mooring station said they gave them beer.. not funny., There was litter around there.The fish feeding, they didn't mention you don't feed them but whatever, and again keeping live marine fish in the way that they are kept didn't look that healthy.The snorkelling was absolutely shocking, too many boats at one given time, and I don't exaggerate to say I couldn't see more than 20cm in front of me (they used the water current as the excuse but the boats were kicking up so much sand it was dangerous and I'll begin to say why) he said \"be careful there are urchins on the rocks\", you couldn't even make out where the rocks were let alone see any urchin but I caught my foot on one and got straight out. I'm a good swimmer and I'm a scuba diver and have been for several years to know what is good and what is bad, if the water is that bad with urchins, they shouldn't let you in. No questions about that one.This area should be left to revive itself before it is all lost.","We went for the Mangrove Tour at Kilim GeoForest Park in a boat ride during our recent trip to Langkawi and it was the highlight of our trip! The mangrove was breathtakingly beautiful & amazing. We signed up with Dev's Adventure Tour and our guide, Yan was very knowledgeable and Captain Man who was driving the boat was very skilful. I appreciate that Dev‚Äôs Adventure tour is an eco tour. They do not feed the eagles. We were told that feeding eagles with chicken skin isn‚Äôt good for the eagles as it is not their natural food and it causes lack in calcium and hence their eggs break easily. I highly recommend to visit the Kilim GeoForest Park for anyone visiting Langkawi, esspecially those who loves nature. This place is suitable for all age groups. We enjoyed ourselves tremendously. We will definitely come again.","A must do if you love nature. You can choose your duration of boat ride and activities.

He said that the wind was stronger than he had thought (it was hard work), but maybe was being tactful about my kayaking skills! We saw various birds, crabs etc and were able to go along narrower channels than when in the tour boats. Afterwards we had a light lunch at the floating restaurant, soup, rice, and juice, very welcome after the trip. I was absolutely soaked in the kayak, we were given a waterproof bag to protect our valuables. An enjoyable and well organised trip.","I did the mangrove kayaking tour and it was disappointing.  I am wondering if this company has changed management as earlier reviews seemed very positive?The guide's English was hard to understand. The descriptions he gave were composed of a few very basic facts - this was not a naturalist guided experience by a long shot. The guide also did not take care to project his voice so that people in the kayaks in the back could hear him (much of the kayaking was in single file as the channels in the mangroves were very narrow). There was no fauna seen whatsoever in the mangroves.  We did see a lot of Brahminy Kites in the main river as they were recently enticed by some boats that had unfortunately thrown out food for them (Dev's to their credit does not do that). The lunch  at the floating restaurant was awful  and barely edible (fried rice, fried eggrolls with nothing in them, watery tom yum soup). I did not enjoy seeing beautiful stingrays and fish being kept captive in crowded little tanks at the \"fish farm\".","2 adults booked via our hotel ,The DannaCost was 360  MYR for the 2 of us.Pick up was 3.30pm from hotel.

They provided me with all the information required the evening before, even giving me details of the driver that would collect me. On the day, the driver was early to pick me up. Like the rest of the team, he was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the island giving me tips throughout. Once in the Geopark, the guide met us all. The actual kayaking was superb. We were taken through the mangroves, the guide telling us all about the local fauna, animals and birds. We were provided with wet bags and water. Kayaking in the middle of the mangroves was just so utterly beautiful and serene. We were 8 in total in the group + guide. The rest of fellow kayakers were all extremely nice and we all got like a house on fire. At the end of the kayaking, complimentary food is served in the floating restaurant. Would I recommend and do a tour with them again? Most definitely yes.","We previously used Dev‚Äôs adventure tours in 2019 and decided to use them again. This time we booked onto the Mangrove Kayaking and the Sun Downer cruise. We met all three of the companies guides on our tours and found them all to be friendly, knowledgable and passionate about doing what they can to protect Langkawi. They shared different details about the Mangroves and KILIM which we found extremely interesting as well as pointing out and talking about a range of wildlife. Both tours provided us with completely different experiences and we explored different areas of the mangroves. The kayaking would be suitable for people with a range of experience, Zack (our guide) demonstrated what to do and kept the pace relaxed. During both tours we had food at the floating restaurant, the food was good and vegetarian options were provided.","Did the mangrove kayaking tour. It was a nice experience. Easy to do and impressive going through the mangroves. Our tourguide Harris was very nice and also explained about the ecosystem of the mangroves. We saw the eagles (without luring them with food) which was great! Lunch at the end was okay, could be better considering the price of the tour. Great thing to do on Langkawi!","Excellent and enjoyable tour with a hugely knowledgeable guide and easy arrangements. Very eco friendly.","We visited langakawi for 3 days with family. I have booked a half day tour to mangrove ! it was an awesome experience !! Thanks to Alex for arranging such a nice trip for us. His communication was very clear and honest since beginning. Arrangements are thoroughly professional and on time.  Muzakkir(Zak) our tour guide is a very capable and trustworthy person. Young guy with lot of knowledge about the places!

A very educational and fun tour. Our young guide Haris was knowledgable but  funny too making the tour lively. We are happy that this is a really eco friendly company embracing/preserving the nature instead of just doing activity to please the tourists caring less of the environment. Excellent!!!","Went for their mangrove kayak and was super impressed with the knowledge that the instructors had shared with us! They were super informative about the nature and was very attentive to us because there were a few inexperienced kayakers but they handled them all pretty well...including me :PDefinitely want to go again and will be bringing my friends with me as well. Thank you, Dev's Adventure Tours!","We (family of 4) did the the Sun Downer Mangrove Tour during our recent trip to Langkawi and it was the highlight of our trip! The mangrove was breathtakingly beautiful & amazing. Our guide, Yan was very knowledgeable and Captain Man who was driving the boat was very skilful. The meal was yummy and comes in very generous portions (we couldn‚Äôt finish). I appreciate that Dev‚Äôs Adventure tour is an eco tour. They do not feed the eagles. We were told that feeding eagles with chicken skin isn‚Äôt good for the eagles as it is not their natural food and it causes lack in calcium and hence their eggs break easily. I highly recommend this tour. There were minimal crowd in the evening and we really enjoyed ourselves tremendously. Next time when we visit Langkawi again we will do the kayak mangrove tour with Dev‚Äôa adventure again.","My husband and I went on a morning kayaking through the mangroves. Our guide, Yan, was kind and knowledgeable; he was also very accommodating. Honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better guide! In the end the kayaking required some work. Then again we wanted to push ourselves a little, and I am glad we did. We have seen monkeys and eagles; we were also rather pleased we have chosen kayaking over a boat ride,  as it allows you to get into rather narrow pathways through the mangrove. With no people in sight, it felt quite magical. My expectations were high due to all of the great reviews here, but honestly I was not disappointed. The service was professional and overall excellent from the very beginning. Alex replied promptly to my queries; Meera has picked us up from our accommodation on time. We were sent clear instructions what to wear and bring prior to the trip too.This experience was certainly worth the price you pay for. I would 100% recommend Dev's to anyone wanting to see some of Langkawi's beautiful nature in a more eco-friendly way.","Excellent experience. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the fauna and flora. And he was very fun! Recommend 100%","What an amazing trip. The team were welcoming and happy. Everything was very well organised and safe with an eco focus. Roy did the most excellent informative narration of our tour and was great with my energetic children. I highly recommend this trip.","I took this tour with my husband. Dev‚Äôs was willing to pick us up and drop us off at our Airbnb (Ranis Lodge) in Kg Nyior Chabang which is quite a ways away from Pantai Cenang and Kuah. Them willing to go that extra mile (literally) was very accommodating and made me feel very welcomed. For the tour itself, our guide Roy was very informative and passionate about making our trip a pleasant one. He made sure to keep up to date on the latest information and was very patient with each and everyone on the boat. It was fascinating to visit the geoforest park at this time of day, and we were even able to see some of the wildlife. I‚Äôm sure it certainly helped that there were less boats manoeuvring the waters at the time. I like that there is a strong focus on sustainability and not contributing to waste with this tour company, and will definitely come back for more soon.","Had a great sunset mangrove tour, very informative and great photo opportunities. Shout out to Roy and Alex for making this a fantastic experience","Myself, my sister and cousin did a morning trip with Dev‚Äôs adventure tours. We had seen reviews on Tripadviser and when in Langkawi we stopped in at their office and picked the kayaking trip for first thing in the morning. To clarify I did this trip in 2019 and have always meant to leave a review as it was such an exceptional experience. The price was more than reasonable for the day, given that we were given water and a light lunch. We were picked up on time and we‚Äôre taken to the area where we met Jerome who was so friendly and explained what to expect and look out for when kayaking through the mangroves. We were particularly impressed by his (and the company‚Äôs) no plastic policy in the water, giving us reusable bottles of water to take and their understanding and concern for the wildlife and sustainability of the mangroves. We got into the kayaks and did a semi-leisurely kayak through the mangroves (you do need a good level of fitness to kayak for a few hours so be sensible when picking this as it‚Äôs not hugely difficult but does require some strength and stamina to navigate the kayak on your own). Jerome was so knowledgeable and fun and kept us really well informed throughout the trip, not only pointing out birds of prey and other wildlife (and snakes!!) to us but also explaining the challenges to sustainability the mangroves are facing. By being in the kayak so close to the water, we felt extremely close to nature and as it was first thing in the morning the mangroves were peaceful and quiet. Jerome was patient with us in the kayaks, going at a reasonable pace.If I remember correctly, the kayaking trip is the most eco friendly way of exploring the mangroves, leaving the least footprint so if you are fit and well enough to do this please do. Please choose your tour operator carefully, Dev‚Äôs adventures seemed to be an extremely responsible company compared to others and it‚Äôs definitely worth going with them. I would highly recommend both Dev‚Äôs adventures and the kayaking experience with Jerome!","Communicating with the company themselves to arrange a booking was so easy and they were very accommodating, even managing to get us in on the same day. My friends and I went for the Mangrove kayaking. Roy was our tour guide and I cannot recommend him highly enough. He was knowledgeable, personable, and always checking to make sure we could keep up/were comfortable with what we were doing."],"serializedRatings":["5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Kedah","place":"Dev's Adventure Tours","serializedDates":["Oct 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo","Aug 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Sep 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Sep 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Aug 2020","Aug 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family","Aug 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Jul 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2020 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Super fun!!","Not to be missed","It was Excellent","Awesome, fun, professional","Great weekend activity - 10/10","Excellent service","Book with Dev's","Excellent","Fantastic kayak trip","Great tour!"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["I had a great time in this activity!

Next time the cycling - hopefully with someone so I won't missed the fun! Worth the money! üôÇ","One of the best and unique experiences we‚Äôve had on a holiday. Every last detail was well planned and executed with high regard to safety. Definitely a must try","I have a good deal with Alex, the one who set up my kayak mangrove trip. The price is so reasonable because it was a private trip for me and my wife. We had a good kayak session with the help of the guide, Abg Yan. It is such a great journey to go for a kayak trip at mangrove. Not to forget, the lunch provided was really good too. Thanks to Dev‚Äôs adventures!","We had a fantastic mangrove, kayaking trip. Everything was organised seamlessly from the moment I inquired over WhatsApp to the booking, pick up, trip and drop off. Abang Yan, our guide, was the best. Hilarious, knowledgeable, great company and so friendly! Same with the lovely lady who picked us up and dropped us off. I'd recommend the mangrove kayaking to anyone, with any level of kayaking experience. ","Was recommended Dev's Tour and would do the same - Alex was extremely responsive (even though we booked the night before!). The mangrove kayaking activity exceeded my expectations and I would be back to try different routes next time. The guide, Yan, is friendly and knowledgeable. 10/10!","The mangrove kayaking tour with Dev's adventure is amazing. Our guide Zac is very professional & knowledgeable. He has been really patient in guiding us as it's our first time kayaking. The hotel pick-up service is on-time, the driver is also very friendly and accommodating.","Alex was great to book with and polite with quick responses putting us at easy straight away. We loved all of the tour and our guide Yan was great, giving us lots of information and we loved his relaxed pace and his stories.¬†He has so much history and his knowledge about the island and nature is exemplary. He pointed our the spots where the animals hide and explained what they are. We had a kayak tour in the Mangroves and just the 2 of us. Pick up was on time safe and a smooth ride. Loved the bat cave and history given.The food was lovely and a beautiful setting which was even better being quiet at the moment being very safe.¬†The whole morning was well organised and we wanted to thank you. We will definitely recommend you to people we speak to. ","A fantastic trip, hard work at times, but well worth it. Our guide, Yan, was really great, and very knowledgeable.","Our group of 10 had an excellent kayak trip with our guide Yan, who was an interesting, knowledgeable and friendly guy. We began by going by boat to the bat cave, where we walked through the cave and saw a lot of bats, then along a walkway through the mangroves where Yan pointed out monkeys, crabs, mudskippers and other wildlife. The boat then took us to the floating restaurant/fish farm where we picked up our kayaks. We had a choice of going solo or in pairs - if you go alone, be aware that it can be quite hard paddling against the current at times. We had all kayaked at least a bit before, so Yan gave us a short briefing then we set off. We were lent small (10L?) waterproof bags for anything we wanted to take, and we could leave other things at the restaurant.We kayaked for about 2.5 hours and it was a mix of open river/sea and mangroves. The scenery was stunning and having already done a boat trip in the area on a previous visit to Langkawi, it was good to see it from a different perspective. We saw Brahminy kites and white bellied sea eagles from the river, and in the mangrove we saw some large crabs and a viper in a tree! At the end we returned to the floating restaurant where we had lunch of tomyam soup and fried rice - there was a choice of chicken, prawn or vegetable. We were very ready for some food at this point!I'd very much recommend Dev's Adventure Tours - their communication was excellent, the staff were friendly and professional, and the trip was great fun. If you're in a large group, contact them directly for a special price - they gave us a very good deal. ","Took a mangrove tour with Dev‚Äôs last week and really enjoyed the trip! Ended up booking a private trip because we really wanted an eco-conscious tour and they hadn‚Äôt had bookings yet for the days we wanted to go. The guide was very friendly and knowledgeable and was quick to point out all sorts of animals, plants, etc and answered all our questions. We saw lots of monkeys, Eagles, crab, fish, monitors, snakes, bats, birds... enjoyed a quick swim and bat cave tour which was cool.

They wouldn‚Äôt even let you take bottles water. Ice cream person was 1/2 empty.The view was good, but that took 15 minutes maximum.","The Skycab (Gondola) ride takes you to the top of the mountain with a stop where you get off to take in some of the views before getting back on a cable car to continue to the top.Arrived shortly before the ticket office opened in the morning and only a short queue Purchased a ticket with a glass floor gondola  to avoid possible queues and this gets you in the express lane as well. There is also no time restriction on this ticket it can be used anytime on the date the ticket has on it.Waited about 10mins and shared the gondola with 5 others on the first section , 2 others on the second section to the top and had the gondola to myself on the way back down. Don‚Äôt book the glass bottom gondola for an exceptional view through the glass on the floor as the glass is scratched due to shoes, fogs up if very humid and with 6 passengers you are looking past other people‚Äôs legs and feet and hand luggage.Views over the tree canopy and a waterfall or two if they are flowing can be seen through the windows of the gondola.Upon reaching the top for a small additional cost you can visit the sky bridge by either walking down and then back up again along a track or use the funicular at a cost.As others have mentioned the wait for the funicular can be lengthy, so walking may be the best option.The Skybridge gives some impressive views over smaller islands and back towards the Pantai Cenang and over tree canopy to the ocean. It also has three glass panels that you can stand on (shoes must be taken off to avoid scratching the glass) Make sure you only go when the weather is good otherwise you may see little of the view and the Skybridge is also closed during strong winds.A few eateries available at the top including an ice cream vendor and toilets with the main food areas around the area where you buy your tickets.The garden and park area as you enter before walking up to the ticket area was poorly maintained and in need of some maintenance.If you don‚Äôt have your own transport best way to get there is a fixed price cab and when it‚Äôs time to return a cab area is located just outside in the same area where you got dropped off.Definitely worth a visit, the amount of time you spend there will depend on the queues, the weather and your own interest in taking in the views.","Great morning here, fab views from the top too. Paid a little extra for express lane and a glass bottomCabin, which was definitely worth it as we had it to ourselves. In some of the non express & non special cabins visitors were being pretty packed in! Would recommend.","Looks like a theme park. The ticket to the skycab takes you up two levels. Get off at the first one to go to the viewing playforms for some great photos then back on again to the next level. The skybridge costs extra but not much. Plenty of places to eat. Toilets cost 1 ringit - try to have small bills cos that helps. ","Amazing view and experience. Reach there in the evening when it is less crowded but most of the places will.shut down after 6 pm.","The view from the top of Skylab is spectacular, however the cable car ride is interrupted halfway to make you wait for hours under the relentless sun. There is no management or interest in providing good service to tourists, making children and adults pay for the inconvenience. The visit to the Skycab is disappointing and not recommended.","Awful, they make you get off from the cart mid way to queue like a dumb person under the sun. Zero consideration for babies or old people, not recommended at all! To be avoided","Amazing views and scenery but be prepared for total chaos trying to return.  Seems like everything is organized as you buy tickets and line up to go up to the top.

The SkyBridge offers an adrenaline-pumping experience as it stretches across the mountain peaks, providing visitors with jaw-dropping views of the surroundings. The engineering marvel of the bridge adds an extra layer of excitement to the SkyCab experience.","Great to do, lovely views! Goes as following.Buy a ticket online at the SkyCab website directly. It wasn‚Äôt possible at the time to buy a Cab only ticket, only a package which cost ‚Ç¨17 pp. If you want to arrive after 10/1030 ‚Äòinvest‚Äô in a fast lane ticket (extra ‚Ç¨10 pp) as well. Get a Grab to the Oriental Village, then a small 5/10 min walk through a ‚Äòpark‚Äô with shops, toilets, ATM and restaurants. Queue 1 for pick up tickets (even if you bought them online or go to counter 6), queue 2 to enter Cab waiting line, then of course the Cab waiting line itself. Here your fast lane ticket comes in handy. With the cableway go to the middle station for a view. Then enter another queue (with fast lane option) for second cable way part. When getting off immediately buy your ticket for the bridge on the left (‚Ç¨3, maybe need to wait in line again). Option to go with the elevator or by stairs. If you are in normal condition; choose the stairs +/- 300 steps (10min). Saves you a queue (without fast lane option) and the elevator is n√≥t spectacular. The bridge is really cool. Much bigger, wider and steadier than for example Curtis Crest treetop (Penang) but so much higher and great views! Glass floor plates nice final touch. Then back in the queue again if you choose the elevator, and then again for the cableway to go down. This only took us 5 min. To be fair, we went on a Friday during school holidays, arrived at 930 and the longest wait was for the elevator to go to the bridge and back. But when we left around 12/1230 it was chaos! So come early and/or outside school holidays. Great attraction either way!","2 hour wait despite pre booking tickets. That‚Äôs after a 30 minute wait to collect tickets. Not much more to say to get over 100 characters","I've been here since 10am and I've queued and queued and I still haven't even got to the end of the line to ascend in the cable car? Arrive early, they said!","Gondolas were clean.  Views were beautiful as you ascend Mt. Machinchang to the middle station.  You even get a glimpse of Seven Wells Waterfall.  Get off at the middle station for awesome views of the mainland & surrounding islands.  At the top station enjoy the views & landscape as wander across the sky bridge & stand on the clear glass flooring, look down below to appreciate just how high up you have traveled.  The Skyglide, not so exciting.  Basically it‚Äôs a one track singular funicular that holds approx. 10 people at a time.  You will need a seperate ticket to ride the Skyglide or better still for free you can walk leisurely down along the nature trail & back up again.  No waiting in the small cramped area, lining up in the heat, sun or other weather conditions the tropics experience.","The views are amazing and this is definitely worth a visit.Frightening heights but incredible at the same time!","Allegedly the steepest cable car in the world and boy is it steep! Fabulous views, really well organised and a good all round experience","Stunning views and lovely experience. Simply a must do in Langkawi. The cable car is a great ride and we used the skyglide too although there are long queues for this as there is only 1 cabin, easier to walk to the skybridge if you can. The skybridge is fabulous and great for photos.","We love Langkawi very much, this time we stay here for one week. We love this island. Hope back again. We enjoyed our local tour. ","We didn't get to see the complete panorama of Langkawi because it was cloudy when we got to the top of the mountain. However, the views from the top were fantastic. A wonderful adventure with breathtaking vistas of Langkawi. We were given expedited tickets. The skyglide up to the bridge was the only thing that required our attention as we waited. Although we were forced to wait for some time at the summit before the clouds could be seen, the wait was well worth it.

We took glass flooring gondola. The glass is not really clear anymore for us to see thru below but we get to go on express lane. Amazing view. Lots of staff to manage the queue. Totally recommend this ride. ","Visiting the Skybridge was at the top of my \"things to do\" list while visiting Langkawi. I took Grab there from my hotel.  It was about a 30-minute ride.It was about a 15-minute walk through the village to get to the entrance. There were no lines.  I bought my ticket, and within minutes,  I was in a gondola up to the top.I want to note that the Skycab ride payment is only for the Skycab.   Once you get to the top, you have to pay another fee to get to the Skybridge. I mistakenly got off at mid-station.   I took some pictures of the views and got back on to the top.I thought it was going yo be a short walk to the Skybridge.   But later found out you have to pay a separate fee to go down to the Skybridge in either a funicular,  which they call a Skyglide,  or walk down 334 steps.  I chose to walk.  It was a nice walk in the rainforest.  It was cool because it had been raining lightly. The Skybridge was great, and the views were magnificent. I highly recommend this activity. There is a lot of walking involved once you get to the top.","The cable car itself was good with nice views however the activities that one can do other than take pictures are almost none. It‚Äôs good to visit once but never again","The sky cab was broken for 2 days when we went. The website was not updated with this info. It stayed open from 12 from 18-23 Oct and when we got there they said 12. Then the tannoy person said delays so starts at 1pm. Then at 1:30 pm the message was 2. We asked for a refund and they were only going to give us a refund for the sky cab. If you pay the full 80rm this covers 4 attractions which on purchase they say to get. What they don‚Äôt say is the sky cab is only 25-30. We spent 3 hours waiting and in the end walked about having seen only the 3D exhibition which is fun.","We enjoyed our visit to the sky bridge despite the changing weather from clear skies to overcast and misty. The ascent / descent in the cable car is rapid and offers fantastic panoramic views of the surrounding areas. With good visibility you can see for kilometres / miles around. The sky bridge may not be for those of a nervous disposition or fear of heights but we would recommend giving it a go. Our visit entailed taking the cable car to the main stopping point, then walking down the many steps to the sky bridge to beat the queue for the furnicular rail car. Having spent time in the bridge enjoying the views we did take the rail car back up. From there we took the steps up to the other vantage points but by then the clouds had closed in. Regardless of this we enjoyed the experience.We couldn‚Äôt see any advantage in paying for the VIP experience. As there were only two of us we found that we got called forward to fill places in a cable car to ensure they were full (they seated six).","Great view from the top.  Didn‚Äôt do the skybridge as scared of heights so ride to the top was enough.  There is also a village of shops and restaurants.","Panorama Langkawi is one part out of four while visiting this place. Cable car or Telefrek 2 ways with a junction stop at the middle. You can continue to the SkyWalk on feet or use elevator for extra charges. The first part will let you see beautiful Langkawi from the top. Many beautiful trees, faunas and monkeys. Don‚Äôt forget to take a picture with the head of the eagle. Continue walk is not easy for elders and children. The steps are not even and a bit risky.","What seemed like a great experience was a bit disappointing. We paid for the skycab, went up, but then suddenly the skybridge was closed. Would have understood this if there was a lot of wind, but there wasn t any wind, just foggy. Going over the skybridge while it was foggy would still have been a nice experience in my opinion.  Could have been an amazing experience, even in the fog.","There is a reason this is the number one Thing to Do in Langkawi. The Sky cab sits high up above the mountains on the north west side of the island was was very close to our hotel. We pre-booked and selected the new 360 sky cable cars,, which effectively meant we had the cable car to ourselves the entire time as it seemed few others booked them. Thankfully, it didn‚Äôt rain so we were able to take in the stunning views. It was very busy during our trip and it was wonderful to see that it was a spot for both local and international tourists. We had a good walk round, taking too many selfies. Do not miss the 3D art gallery as that was awesome. We didn‚Äôt go on the bridge or sky glide as the queues were rather long and we didn‚Äôt fancy a long walk - the rain was also threatening at this point - but if you can, don‚Äôt miss these.","We were very unlucky as it was a cloudy day when we went. So, we could not see the lovely scenery of Langkawi from the top. But, still overall, me and my family enjoyed to some extent.We bought our tickets on Klook - which was a combined one for glass gondola + Sky Glide (funicular lift) + Express Lane + Sky Bridge for RM 120 each. The Express Lane was very worth it because we saw a huge line for ordinary lane and an absolutely empty Express Lane. We could wiz through. Also, every time you have to take the gondola to go up and come down, you are given preference because of the Express Lane. So, I will definitely recommend that.We took the Glass Gondola which was not very impressive. The glass floor was not very clear. So, I would recommend taking an ordinary gondola. Also, the glass gondola takes a lot of time to come so you have to keep waiting. So, the Express Lane ticket then becomes a waste. So, take ordinary gondola, but opt for Express Lane. I think that's the best combination.There is a mid station which we were not aware about which is pretty useless. So, if you have less time, then you can avoid getting down at the mid station and continue your journey to the higher and last station.At the last station is where you get down and go to the remarkable Sky Bridge. You can either go by stairs or take the Sky Glide which is a funicular elevator. There is a short queue for that as the elevator takes in about 10 people at a time. If there is a huge rush then the waiting time here could be much longer. But, still it is worth it to take the funicular because of the novelty of it and the lovely view you get from there. While going to the Sky Bridge, the funicular goes down and when you come back it goes up. Also, a tip for a nice video. When the funicular goes up stand in the front side and take a video as it moves up. This will be a nice video of the track and the beautiful surrounding as you go up.At the Sky Bridge it was a disappointment because it was all very cloudy and misty and we could not see anything from there. However, since we went on the Malaysia Independence Day weekend, the Sky Bridge was beautifully decorated with many Malaysia flags. It is a nice back drop for a photograph as you stand on the bridge.After we came back up from the Sky Bridge to the last station, I related to my family about the fact that Shah Rukh Khan's Don movie was shot there - the climax scene between him and Boman Irani. We actually found the platform where it was shot and clicked a photograph there!There is also a bridge where people in love put up locks. There are thousands of locks there and again makes a beautiful back drop for a picture. There is a cafe and an ice cream parlour. We enjoyed hot corn and ice cream there before we made our way back down the gondola. The entrance to the Sky Cab is through a shopping centre called Oriental Village. It is quite pretty with lots of garment shops + eateries. My wife and my daughter bought very nice linen pyjamas there. Overall, we spent around 1.5 hours there. My most important tip would be to check the weather. If it is cloudy then wait for it to clear up. The best part is to see the view from top.

The food stalls above the market left me in daze because i had too many choice to do.  But since last time i ate the Nasi Kerabu (the blueish colour rice) with Lada Solok and fried fish, this time i tried Mee Hoon Celup (soup noodles) with beef intestines.  It was so delicious that i decided to buy another take away to eat for lunch.On the other side of the building i bought several pieces of Tudung Bawal (hijab scarves) with beautiful fake diamonds.  They are not cheap but the ones sold here offered a wide range of patterns.  After some haggles, i bought 4 pieces with RM100.00.  I picked a songket as a souvenir for a friend because we promised to wear songket together for our next oversea's rendezvous (i couldnt haggle much with the price - if you wanted a cheaper price for original Kelantanese songket, i recommend you to got to Wakaf Che Yeh's market)Going down, i stopped to buy a few dozens of fish crackers in mini packets, serunding (i bought chicken, beef and fish serunding), Kelantanese dodol, and a few packets of cashew nuts.On the ground floor of the market, my shopping bags turned heavier.  I bought a few bottles of budu (I asked for the one made locally by the Kelantanese), a few bottles of pickles, several kilos of fresh fruits (mango, bidara and kuran), Kelantanese cakes (from taik itik, jala emas, buah tanjung, gula tarik, kuih peria) and Kelantanese dishes such as nasi tumpang and etak salai.During this trip i made sure to get my stock of facial masker, bedak sejuk.  Bedak sejuk is a local facial masker made of pounded rice the ones made by the Kelantanese are my favourite because they are purely rice and without preservative or  chemical stuff.  Now you know my secret to m great, pimpleless face.  There are two types of bedak sejuk sold in Pasar Siti Khatijah.  The white and yellow little beads.  I used the ordinary white ones.   Last but not least, i stopped by at the Dayak Spirit for a special souvenir.  Thanks to a travel blogger I found out about this place within the Pasar.  The booth sells souvenirs related to the American Indian's tribe.  Its Dream Catcher was one of the reasons the booth caught my attention.  I usually bought a talisman for a trip for a memory and to add into my growing collection (I collect for its art/craft and not for its traditional uses) .  Whats truly special about Dayak Spirit is that, the owner of the booth, Uncle Abu Antonio, hand-made them himself with chicken feathers.  Trust me, they are made of good quality and cheaper than anything ive bought online or overseas.","I can understand the attraction for Western tourists who have never been to an Asian market but for tourists from Southeast Asia, this market is nothing special and hence this attraction should not be ranked No 1. It's stuffy, dirty, claustrophobic, crowded, full of traffic jams outside and totally unsuitable for families with small children. ","Got many level with different type of sales.

They serve Malay and a mix of Thai dishes too but I hope they replace the oils used for frying the seafoods on sticks. That's all I think that they need to change there.

The gentleman who gave the tour was just about the least interested in giving the tour as I could imagine. Right from the start, I got the impression he wanted the tour to end as quickly as possible and his style was to rush through every room with minimal explanation. His spoken english wasn‚Äôt that great either. After the guided tour ended, I went back to the front, grabbed the handbook for the self guided tour and went through that, which made it a much more enjoyable experience. More importantly, I actually learnt something about the house and the family. I thought the house was beautiful with some exquisite woodwork and embroidery. The upstairs master/wedding bedroom has some two amazing wedding gowns and other wedding items.Based on my experience, I‚Äôd say do yourself a favour and visit on a self-guided tour.

The place was lovely and clean and when the dogs entered they all seemed very well looked after and happy. They ran around playing with each other and of course the staff monitored if their behaviour got a bit excited. I read reports before that people weren‚Äôt happy with the way the dogs were treated. I honestly didn‚Äôt see any of that. Yes the dogs are moved around into position to take good photos but you need to remember that pay for the dogs keep. It can‚Äôt be cheap caring for over 40 dogs! We were a small group and yes I can imagine the dogs might get a bit fed up of having photos taken but they really are well trained. You could tell the dogs loved the staff and they were not scared of them at all. They do everything for treats, no different to my dog at home. The staff answered all my questions about how they care for the dogs, including what walks they go on and their daily routine. I loved the place and would defiantly recommend going. Go early for the first session, the dogs were so lively and excited then!","I'm from KL and came here just for their dogs. Turns out, it was a very good decision üòÅ. Fun staff and even cuter dogs!!

A must visit place if you are a dog lover‚Ä¶ I loved this experience","On the 27th of Nov, 2023, I visited The Huskitory in Malacca with family at around 1.30-2pm. We were looking forward to interact with the huskies. We were there for 2 hours. The place was clean and pristine and the dogs appeared well groomed. Unanticipatedly, the three of us including mom and I, observed various acts of cruelty inflicted on the dogs that day, that made us sad and angry. We witnessed the staff, Peishi and Amber pulling several dogs by the scruff and legs, yanking on the dogs‚Äô faces, even grabbing one dog by its throat forcefully to move the dog. The mishandling by the staff were observed sporadically, particularly during the process of assembling the dogs for customers‚Äô paid group photo. We noticed one husky yelped and growled in pain in response to Amber yanking its belly or pelvic skin to move that dog for group photo taking. We then observed it licking the painful area woefully while Amber and other staff unsympathetically shoved it and the other dogs to pose for the picture. We also saw a lady staff struck one of the dogs on its head with a heavy container in jest. It seems unsurprising now that most of the dogs at the cafe were submissive and placid, Huskies are usually more playful and exuberant. It disturbs me to imagine what the dogs have to endure every day during patrons‚Äô visiting hours or even aside visiting hours with such seemingly cruel staff.I realised after reading The Huskitory- Google and TripAdvisor reviews that many visitors had observed similar cruel acts and rough handling of the huskies since almost a year ago. A recent, two week old review indicated some of the huskies were observed to be unwell and lethargic and they had saw a male staff flipped over one of the sick dogs like a rag doll for photo taking. Seems all low star Google reviews are bumped to the bottom. We had not thought of taking photos or videos to record the mistreatment of the dogs we observed that day as the initial plan was to give feedback to the establishment‚Äôs owner after returning home. Having checked online after, regarding procedures for reporting animal abuse in Malaysia, seems photo and video evidence of abuse are required for effective reporting. I urge future visitors to pay attention to the cafe staffs‚Äô interactions with the huskies and record any abuse observed in the form of photos and videos- the website states videos make strong evidence- and report the abuse to authorities.The dogs at The Huskitory cafe cannot speak for themselves. They need our voice and our help to hopefully make their lives safer and happier.","There are a lot of huskies:) Dogs were so cute and adorable. I had a good time and really enjoyed playing with them. I wanna go there again:)","Really cool cuddle experience! We had the whole Huskatory for ourselves.

It starts from across Malacca River near the Stadthuys, with the street in the area filled with historical houses along its left and right sides many of which are shops selling antiques, textiles, foods, handicrafts and souvenirs.The area turns into a night market every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.","A must visit when here I guess. Some great old architecture and colourful buildings. Lots of shops for tourists and good coffee shops bars and restaurants.

You may be surprised that you would enjoy the historical architecture of the historical buildings dating back to the 17th century and shops.  Of course they will be selling lots of touristy stuff but there‚Äôs also some beautiful cafes and temples and Hang Katsuri mausoleum.","Good for tourist. Start arriving about 6pm as the stores would be almost fully setup. Take your time walking. The stores will repeat and food is plenty. So pace yourselves. If you got young kids, don‚Äôt bring a pram but do bring a fan and lots of water. ","Went there on weekdays, so its not so packed.

Cheap clothes & hand made accessories ( good earrings). Good place","We took a stroll down Jonker Street, it was of interest but similar to other old cities in Asia. Despite this it was worth the stroll especially viewing the historical buildings at the beginning of the street.","It's a place where you went to waste my times right there but what I could say that the thing that you will find the same food stall in the every corner of the street food in Junker so pretty much low in food variation like you will find the similar  cuisine stall in the next 100 M.Despite being called street food, the food and beverage were actually too expensive to be called street food and there were a lot of foods that would take a very long time to wait for around 30 minutes.The food cuisine that used to be potrayed in social media like abalone and stuff trust me it's not really worth to try. They're just add up onion oil and roasted which 3 of it costed around 25 RM and the taste were gonna make you cry. Some abalones were not cooked well and mostly were not fresh.If you try to find a dinner in the street food would be pretty much challenging since majority were snacks. Which I personally would suggest that would be wise to find a decent dinner before you visiting market.What we found annoying the most were the sewer smells you could find wherever you pass by.It's mostly good for a walk but if you are the person that doesn't prefer to walk in crowd and being clamp with a lot of people it won't be good for people like us.","Nice place to walk. Many small shops down the whole street. Try taking a walk in the morning and evening. There will be different things to see.Go on a Friday Saturday or Sunday night from 6-11pm and there will be a night market available. Good place to shop for bargains and cute items.

Along Jonker Walk most of the shop houses were actually closed which was thoroughly disappointing. We were told that many of the businesses close down and just go to visit their family before Chinese new year, so maybe it was the timing of our visit.

Better to walk as there are many people here and parking spot is very limited.","I visited the shop on 26th Dec 2022 with two other families, total 11 pax. Ordered food (nonya laksa, nasi lemak, roti canai), drinks and desserts at 10.05pm. Nasi lemak without nasi and was offered chicken rice as replacement. Took 10mins to serve few drinks and 15mins to serve two plates of french fries. The french fries portion was so little that Macdonalds' regular french fries was probably much more. Waited 45mins (from time of order) and the other food (roti canai and nasi lemak) was not served. Approached the boss, he said coming and I questioned him how long more as we had waited 45mins for that few easy ready dishes. He was unhappy and told me to cook myself. I was fuming mad at his reply. I rebarked at his reply that I would not have patronised his shop if i had to cook myself. We decided to leave the place without waiting for the food. His attitude was terrible and arrogant. Overall the place was dirty too, the washing area was right beside the toilet. The utensils were not washed properly. He was not insincere towards his customers, despite being at the tourists attraction. It was a terrible and unforgettable experience. Be prepared for the long wait and lousy service if you are visiting.","Nothing much and the prices for the foods and other things is more expensive compare to KL. A small watermelon juice can rm 14 . 1 stick of few small jelly cost rm 8. The people in the shops are not that friendly. You have to get ready some coins as you can only use the public toilet outside and they charge 30 cents. Nothing much and won't go back again as I personally find that it's a waste of time. ","This is a famous tourist attraction but I don't see why. Although there are many shops and eateries here there's really nothing special about this place. My favorite part was walking past all the murals which are properly maintained and good for photo taking.

Called both the Red Square and Dutch Square because all the buildings are painted red and for the Dutch inspired architecture.

Wear good shoes as some walking is involved to cover the whole complex.  As soon as you arrive, the static displays of armoured personnel carriers and fighter jets will welcome you.  The entire front portion is occupied by howitzers, Anti Aircraft Guns, small to medium cannons, mortars, a Scorpion Tank, as well as a Troop Carrier that saw action. Some are accesible, so one can slip in and experience what a gunner feels when in the heat of battle. Within the building are exhibits of famous battles, the World War 2 campaign, and the war against the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). There is a tunnel that replicates a typical CPM stronghold, complete with field hospital, lodging and kitchen.  Some of the write-up can be too wordy, but it conveys the hardship normal Malayan's had to endure, and the role played by our brave Tentera Darat or Armed Forces to defeat our enemies. There is a rope bridge system connected to trees behind the convenience store, so do give it a go.  After that experience, treat yourself to a nice ice cream on the benches provided.

There are also quite a few different weapons on display to see. There are 2 small cafes on site and everytime I pass the museum I can't help dropping by at one of them to get my Pineapple Coffee from Mak Orkid cafe. Divine!

There is only one person on duty at the registration counter. No one to ask if you wish to get more details on the exhibits.2. Although new, the toilet lock has broken due to excessive use. The other toilet has been purposely locked for unknown reasons. 3. One has to walk about 100 meters under the sky to reach the entrance. Just imagine the inconvenience during rainy days. 4. The coral cultivation and fish breeding labs are crisscrossed with water pumps and other electrical equipments. But the areas have been left unattended. Always keep an eye on your children for safety concerns. 5. The turtle tanks are quite small in size. I am not so sure, but the bigger turtles could be stressed by the limited space. 6.

My advie would be to try the Bukit Putus starting point especially for beginners. Especially popular during weekends. The trail is well marked and with many trekkers ascending and descending, almost impossible to get lost! For beginners, I would advise you to take it slow and easy. Do not rush as you might find the going very challenging especially if you are not used to trekking up a mountain. I would advise you to go in a group as the group dynamics will help push you to keep going. Enjoy the scenery, stop to appreciate the various shapes and colors of the flora. You should come across some very strange shaped plants and flowers along the trail. Keep your ears tuned to the various sounds of the forest and you will soon appreciate the calls of various birds, monkeys, insects and other animals. Once you reach the peak, you will realize every ache in your muscles was worth it!  A great trail especially for those who enjoy nature walks and being away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Only an hour and half drive from KL City center.","I was here last 2 weeks. The trails is quite difficult for beginners. The view up there is worth it. I took entrance from Bukit Putus.

U just need to pay RM5 for the hiking permit at the starting point either at Bukit Putus or at Ulu Bendol. Normal hiking pace took us 1 1/2 hours to the peak. It was a cloudy and breezy day. It was a good day to hike. So after reached the peak rested awhile and eat the snacks we have brought up. Going down, we decided to try Ulu Bendul trail. It was longer and steep at first. Luckily we took this trail as we can stop by at the river and dip into the cool waters. It took us 2 1/2 hours on the way down including river detour. At Ulu Bendul you need to go back to Bukit Putus by walking takes you another 3km or find a taxi or other transport for a fee. It was a good around 14km exercise. I will try the other way around next time. You should too.","Took us about 90 minutes up and 90 minutes down for the entire hike.

A clear path is available made by the Forestry department. Strictly for nature lovers n those with very strong knees.","Gunung Angsi is the third highest peak in Negri Sembilan. It is about an hour's drive from Kuala Lumpur and is located in the Ulu Bendul Recreation Park. The park itself has clear streams and nice picnic spots. The hike will take from an hour to 3 hours depending on level of fitness. It is a relatively easy track and the view at the top is not very rewarding. Still it is a popular climbing spot and is ideal for beginners as well as children.","A mountain we like very much, we don't need to rush there early in the morning to do hiking because the mountain itself covered by trees, so u don't feel the heat even you start to hike at 10am in the morning.

","Last Saturday Feb 3, 2018 was my first climb up Mount Angsi. Me and my nephew started at the foothill at 2.30pm and reached the summit slightly after 4pm. We started late because this was the second mountain of three mountains we climbed that day (Mount Datuk near Rembau and Batu Putih at Tanjung Tuan, Port Dickson was third). The climb to Mount Angsi is a good trekking experience for most including starters and children as young as 6 and those as old as 70s though the trail started off with as slippery muddy path along steep slope uphill under a thick tropical rain forest in about a third of the journey but the rest two thirds were much gentler.  To enjoy the walk and the scenery downhill at several stop points and the surrounding at the summit, take your sweet time but need to start early. Rainy days could be more challenging, though dangerous, due to the wet and slippery nature of the mud path."],"serializedRatings":["4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","3.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Negeri Sembilan","place":"Gunung Angsi","serializedDates":["Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Family","Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Aug 2017 ‚Ä¢ Solo","Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Apr 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Feb 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Apr 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family","Aug 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Trekking in Negeri Sembilan","Visit To Gunung Angsi ","Best workout choice?","Good walk withj some views as well as waterfalls and swimming","Beauty Of Nature....Speechless","Healthy lifestyle...","Tough for a first time hiker, a breeze for experienced.","First Time in Gunung Angsi - Bit Tough for a Non-Trekker","Angsi climb","Great Workout in clean, natural surroundings"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["Takes about 2 to 3 hours to get on top...good place for trekking, but need to be relatively fit or go in groups.","It is a relatively easy trek. The weather however play a trick on us. A heavy down pour close to 30mins did not deter us to climb which we are about three quarter through. There isn't much view especially after the rain. However we have enjoyed the walk amid the rain.","So the third tallest peak in NS‚Äôs state. Distance is shorter compare to Gunung Datuk, but it‚Äôs more tiring I ensure you. There‚Äôs 2 entry u can go with, Ulu Bendul and Bukit Putus. I had to choose Bukit Putus due to the gate at Ulu Bendul close because of bad weather yesterday(flooded). Both side had officer working for entry permit. If you can‚Äôt access to Ulu Bendul due to the guards, ask for Help from the officer at Bukit Putus he‚Äôll grant u a permission. So Bukit Putus side was challenging, the steep was incredibly hard on first 400-500m. Then relax mode till the second hill where there‚Äôs a hard steep again. Extra:**If you worry about water, rest easy since Bukit Putus side have a water stream for you to refill drinks or drink directly. Less weight to carry.**Entry fees: myr 5**Friendly hikers shares food and drink.**It takes me less than an hour and a half hike, but I think average is around 1 and a half hour. ","A great half-day walk, combining some views from the peak with cascades and river crossings. I‚Äôd definitely recommend the Ulu Bendul route, or going up one way and back the other for variety.It‚Äôs about an hour from my KL to Seremban, about 60km to the south, and then another 20min drive to the start of one of the trail. We took the Bukit Putus route up, which is the shorter and more direct route, starting at an altitude of 285m. The descent we are taking is the longer Ulu Bendul trail. It‚Äôs narrower and seems less trafficked than the Bukit Putus route we took up (although other trip reports suggest this longer route is more popular) ‚Äì and descends even more steeply. In a number of places there are sections of rope in place to help descend the slippery track. There's a number of very picturesque cascades and swimming holes once you reach the valley.It's about 4km via Bukit Putus and 7km via Ulu Bendul route (+3km if you're walking along the highway to connect the two trails - best to have two vehicles if possible).","With colleagues it's was an first experience on trekking.Even we feel tired we still have the willpower to complete ur task.Anyway we complete it succesfully.Not similar as wht I have been..Good scenery..Cool breeze..tq","Get know the place by my close friends.First experience on hiking activities make me fell tried.Its took around 3h 15min to reach the top.Happy for spend money on beneficial activities.keep it n grow muscle..haha","There are two ways to hike Gunung Angsi - either by the Ulu Bendul route or the Bukit Putus route. The Ulu Bendul route is longer and more adventurous (with rivers to cross) while the Bukit Putus route is shorter and more challenging. Both routes require you to pay a nominal fee (RM5) to the Forestry department. For my last trip, the night before rained thus the hike was quite challenging - it was very muddy and slippery. Do not expect your clothes and shoes to be in one piece. The view on the top is nothing to be in awe for but Gunung Angsi proves to be very beginner-friendly with a clear track and good telephone connection.   Beginners will take about 2-3 hours to reach the top while experienced hikers will arrive at the top in less than 1 hour.","It was my first trekking over the last 5-6 years & first in Malaysia also. We have opted the route along side resort and it is easy for the first 1-1.5 hrs. & later on become very steep for the next. You have the opportunity to walk along a water trail & there are places to align with nature. Beware of leaches !!! Better carry enough fluid to hydrate yourself. Lot of professional young trekkers walk along,when asked they say 2.5 hrs is OK to climb, but for us it took more than 4.5 hrs one way. Return was thrilling as we caught up in heavy rain and the walk path has become like water falls and difficult to see the path in front............Prepare yourself and move on if you are not a frequent trekker","A challenging hike. Trail full of obstacles due to undergrowth and uneven surface. Need good stamina n endurance.Being a novice i took 4 over hours to reach the top. Good for youngsters to try climbing. Reaching the peak is very rewarding. Enjoyed it even with the fatigue setting in. Might do it again one day.","Gunung Angsi may be accessed via Ulu Bendol and Bukit Putus. For the more adventurous, a Trans Angsi hike starting from one trail and returning by the other is highly recommended. This way, you can truly experience the differences and similarities of both trails in a single outing.  Do set aside at least 5 hours and be prepared to walk 4km on the highway to get back to your car.Indicative time and route (moderate pace)1.\tAngsi - Bukit Putus return : 3.0  hrs  (1.5 up, 1 down)2.\tTrans Angsi - Bukit Putus / Ulu Bendol : 4.15 hrs (1.5 up, 2 down, 45 mins walk to car)3.\tTrans Angsi ‚Äì Ulu Bendol / Bukit Putus : 4.45 hrs (3 up, 1 down, 45 mins walk to car)4.\tAngsi ‚Äì Ulu Bendol return : 5.0  hrs  (3 up, 2 down)The Ulu bendol route offers a river/water trail (5.5km) with two river crossings while the Bukit Putus route (4.4km) has more open views of Kuala Pilah town and the Reservoir. It is pleasantly cool in the mornings, so start early to avoid the heat. I went up Angsi from Ulu Bendol. The first hour is easy, walking alongside the pipeline upriver. After the second river crossing, it‚Äôs uphill all the way, for the next 1.5 hours. Midway, there is a huge sand boulder that is impossible to miss. Use the ropes to hoist yourself up. The ropes will be useful as support on the way down later. We summited shortly after 11am, amazed at the huge, garden-like open space that was packed with at least 50 hikers, mostly from the Bukit Putus trail. As expected, the views are not much to shout about. The satisfaction of reaching the peak is what keeps hikers going. Going down was much faster, about 2 hours. As this was the less travelled route, we only met other hikers during our descent. Back at the trailhead, the picnic crowd had arrived, spread out on both sides of the river, with some enjoying a dip in the refreshing waters.  Ulu Bendol has a proper carpark with toilet and changing room facilities. There are also food stalls to cater to the weekend crowd. Entry Fee to Gunung Angsi - RM 5 per person. (Pay at Ranger's Office)Toilet Fee - RM0.50Conclusion : I found the hike challenging and enjoyable. The trails are well defined, temperature cooler due to proximity to the river and dense forest. The park maintenance team does well enough to keep the trails litter free. For beginners, start from Bukit Putus."],"serializedRatings":["4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Negeri Sembilan","place":"Gunung Angsi","serializedDates":["Dec 2016 ‚Ä¢ Solo","Oct 2016 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2016 ‚Ä¢ Family","Oct 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jun 2016","Dec 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Aug 2015 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Sep 2015","Sep 2015 ‚Ä¢ Family"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Cleanliness ","Nice track","challenging tracking","Beginner.","Good nature experience","Trekking","Good for a starter","Hiking in dense vegetation","Good place to hike!","Good for weekly exercise and training!"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["This place once used to be awesome, now much polluted and quite rundown.This place still has it's crowds during weekends.","Enjoyed hiking here a lot...

The trail head as the Gunung Putus. The hike is fairly easy and  we really have a great time. The best thing is to have lunch at Kuala Pilah food square. The highlight are the Cendol, Rojak noodle and turtle soup. ","This mountain is not high enough to experienced climbers like myself but good for those who want to try climbing a mountain. The view at the top is not promising and quite hot during dry season. it has two access therefore, i would advise to climbers to climb from either entrance and descend on the other entrance. however, ensure you have transport waiting for you at the exit. You should bring water, enough for a day since there is no water point at the top.","Good hike. Takes about 4 to 5 hours to complete the journey. It's 825m high but doesn't really offer much of a view. The journey up is really interesting. Due to dense vegetation, you can easily hike this beast during the day. It's pretty cooling in the jungle and well shaded. There is a little forest cafe along one of the path, if you're interested. Lots of insects to see and enjoy.","The mother nature is always beautiful, but please do not underestimate mothernature. Gunung Angsi is my favorite place to hike, not to hike but still the scenery is awesome! Still need to be fit to hike, but dont worry, just enjoy your hike and everything will be fine. I can guide you there if you want, just tell me when, if i free , will guide you all with pleasure!","There are 2 trails for Gunung Angsi, one is the longer route (about 3 hours up) and another is the shorter path which for regular hikers, going up should take about 1.5 hour and going down is a breeze, could be less than an hour with speed. Mind you, that's for regulars. Normal people is about 2 hours ascending and probably 1.5 hour for descent. The first 1km hike is fairly steep but after that, it's not that tough. View from the top is not really astounding, but then this is very subjective.

She was very passionate and detailed. We had so much fun and learned a lot about the building. The tour with Sally is highly recommended!!!","Visited the Blue Mansion with my mother today. While the mansion was very pretty, we felt that there was not much to see compared to the other museum. Nevertheless, we still think that it‚Äôs a must-visit in Penang!In addition, we want to extend our gratitude to Selva, who made our visit super memorable. Selva was super friendly when helping us take photos, and the photos that look exactly like that of a professional photographer! He truly is a star of the Blue Mansion!","My only complaint is that tour group sizes are too big. There were more than 30 people and the volume of the tour guide was quite soft. If I stand too far I couldn't hear much. There were also children running around making lots of noises.  ","Guided tour requires an App to be downloaded, there is wifi available there, best to have headphones to be able to listen in a non-cacophony way. Interesting restored building, now a hotel","I must mention that Selva was a very helpful staff that assisted us in taking pictures from various angles at the Courtyard which really made up for the shortcomings of the visit. I have mixed feelings about the visit as the self guided tour was the same price as guided fyi (so you are better off booking the guided tour). The website did indicate that some parts of the mansion is beyond public visit (excld. in-house guest and visitors on tours) so not sure if this was an issue with the self guided tour. However, the visit of the mansion itself was a slight letdown as there weren't that many artefacts or areas to visit. The place gained much fame from a renowned movie and I was definitely expecting more from the tour.","The visit is totally overrated and not worth the 25 RM. There is nothing special to see and they sell a lot of tickets. Visit Pinang Peranakan Mansion and you see what you expecte from the mansion.There are only a few rooms to see. The best look is from the  outside","Wonderful experience. Staff by the name of Selva was very helpful and accommodative. Polite in explaining to us the history and background as well as taking beautiful shots for us. We highly recommend to visit, worth every penny.","The mansion was really nice to see. Welcoming staff too but what made the experience the best was Selva. He knew so much about that place and brought it back to life. His knowledge and character made the experience so much better. I advise if you go ask to get a tour from him. The peanut butter milkshake at the bar was also really delicious. All in all an amazing memory.","The tour was fascinating and super informative. The guide ( English lady) has a real talent for storytelling! The place is mesmerising and thanks to an employee called Selva, we took great pictures and lifelong memories with us! Thank you!","I bought ticket of guided tour, the introduction of the mansion are very clear and some little fun fact about the mansion is also nice. I'm visiting alone and the people there are very nice, especially Mr Selva, he saw I'm by myself and kindly asking me whether I need somebody to take photo of me. He also suggests some places that looked nice to be taken as photo and his photography skill is a good one, I'm a shy person so I very appreciate his concern that makes me to save some memory there.

Lots of steps so not practical for anyone with mobility issues. Considering this was built in 1891 it is an amazing complex.","What a waste of time.  The ride up was appalling with multiple stages involved and with staff barking at you like dogs.  Crowded and hot with not much to see at all.  You can‚Äôt even get a good view of the statue. The waiting times for the ‚Äòlifts‚Äô up and down were too much.  We couldn‚Äôt wait to leave.","Built since the year 1891, Kek Lok Si Temple situated in the island of Penang, Malaysia, is one of the largest and finest temples complexes in Southeast Asia.With millions of magnificent images of Buddha and hundreds of beautiful meaningful carvings, sculptures and murals in the interior and exterior of the temple halls, pagodas and archways, Kek Lok Si Temple is not just a center for Chinese culture and Buddha teaching, but also an unique heritage treasures that have Mahayana Buddhism and traditional Chinese rituals blend into a harmonious whole, in temple architecture and daily activities of worshipers.","This place is amazing and definitely worth a visit. How this was built in 1891 I‚Äôll never know. Its stands high above Penang with fantastic views. There are plenty of steps which can be an issue if you‚Äôre not too mobile, especially in 35 degree heat. There are a couple of inclined lifts which can help. You do need to take one up to the top to see the 30m high Buddha. Highly recommended","A splendid time well spend going back to ancient Chinese history visited the Goddess Of Mercy with many Gods. Architecture are well maintained even though is quiet old; a time of relaxation and time of well spend with family bringing them around mesmerising the scenery and moments together. üíûüíû","We hired a driver who drove us all the way up to the new wing where a 30m bronze statue of the Guan Yin under a pavilion stands. As the temple is on a hill, you get to see Air Hitam town and the surroundings (better view than Penang Hill summit which was shrouded in cloud). We came because it is a stone throw from Penang Hill funicular station and also a major tourist attraction.","For people who enjoy Buddhist temples and their spiritual meaning. This is the place to be. The tip I would advise is to go in the morning to enjoy the temple before the sun is at its highest. You would need about 3 hours to appreciate the temple fully‚Äîa must-visit for all.","Kek Lok Si Temple is a Buddhist temple situated in Penang, Malaysia. It is the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia, and is also an important pilgrimage centre for Buddhists from Hong Kong, Philippines, Singapore and others. Be prepared for a good walk.","We got a grab to kek lok si, it is a huge and beautiful complex, make sure to explore all the different areas, it is huge and diverse. The huge Kuan Yin at the top is simple breathtaking, so huge and beautiful, photos just can‚Äôt do it justice. Very happy to have experienced KekLokSi and recommend a visit, probably set aside a good 2 or 3 hours ","My taxi driver dropped me off at what I assumed was level 1. Walked around and found my way up to level 2. From level 2 they are running a minivan service costing MYR6 return to the upper levels. Many nice things to see including the ornate prayer houses.I had read about a tram but I think this is currently been replaced by the minivan service. A lot of ongoing construction all around.

Although the place is quite touristy the temple energy and peaceful atmosphere can definitely be felt there. Great place to spend at leas half of the day there and enjoy the beauty and tranquility and make some wishes.","This place was great. Best temple I visited in Malaysia. Plan to spend an hour and a half or so. It just keeps going. So. Many. Buddhas.","I didn't do my research. I assumed you could turn up, get your ticket with a free guide and a map and away you go.  Quite the opposite. This place is focused on making money out of tourists and care little for your experience. I bought a return ticket for the lift and followed everyone to the top which involved different lifts and a buggy cart.  I got to the top and thought, this cannot be everything. It wasn't.  I found out by chance on the way down when I got lost and realised there was more to see. This place is haphazard and don't ask the staff for help.  All they want to know is Where's your ticket and get very aggressive too.  No signage makes this place confusing.  Throw in the crowds on an oppressive hot day and I was done.What a waste of a morning.","I came here when I was a young child, I have this wonderful opportunity to bring my kids to visit. Of course there are so many changes but the old structure of the Chinese temple, pagoda visit and the tram to see the goddess of mercy status at the top of the hill. You will need to pay rm3 per person for the tram and rm2 to climb the pagoda. Don‚Äôt forget to try the food hawkers by the market below.","This site is up on a hill side so has a great view of the town below. It‚Äôs an extensive site with lots to see. It could be amazing but it‚Äôs so poorly maintained, it really spoils it. It is worth the wait to catch the lift to the top to see the giant statue. It‚Äôs ok, but could be better.","Absolutely beautiful Chinese Buddhist temple on the side of a hill in Penang. I lost track of how many temples were on this one site but they were all stunning. Definitely prioritise this if you are in Penang! No fans or air con so would recommend getting up early to go. ","Such  a beautiful temple with fascinating rock formations. We went on a hot day but it was pretty cool inside the temple. There is a very small area for your to do some paddle-boating and cycling ..it was great as the limestone hills blocked out the morning sun and the boating/cycling area was in its shade. A shame that with such large grounds, the recreation area is sooooo tiny and the paddle boats practically filled the entire area. For the cycling, we had to keep going in circles and it got boring after a while. Still we managed to spend an enjoyable 3-4 hours here. The place is clean and the washroom i used was pretty clean too (by malaysian standards). Its free, but we made a small donation. Worth visiting.","A very beautiful temple with some really magnificent artwork and designs. It‚Äôs also very large and free to enter - you can stay here quite a while. The only bits which you have to pay for is the entry to the tall pagoda (2 ringgit each) and if you want, the lift up to the big Buddha (3 ringgit one way). The only downside I thought was the amount of scaffolding and roof tiles, wheelbarrows and tools just left around the place, all in visible view when walking round. It kinda took away the authenticity of it. Overall though, absolutely worth a visit.","Kek Lok Si Temple is an imposing structure on the side of Penang Hill, hovering majestically over George Town and the East side of Penang itself. As a destination to visit and dip you toes into the local culture, it should definitely be on the list. It has a number of well-kept temples, along with a distinctive pagoda and a wonderous statue that is certainly an impressive site to behold. Be sure to arrive early, have a fleeting glance at the local goods and food options, but try to tick off the main attractions before the hoards arrive. Whilst overall it is impressive, it doesn't offer the real wow-factor that you might get from other cultural sites around SE-Asia. It's definitely worth a visit, and you can easily spend 1-2 hours, especially if you are tempted to visit in the middle of the day or during one of the many Malaysian festivals throughout the year.","Avoid the tram service it‚Äôs a tourist trap Rude operations which give no sign of clear direction and scream at for no reason."],"serializedRatings":["4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","3.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","3.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Penang","place":"Kek Lok Si Temple","serializedDates":["Jan 2023","Feb 2023","Mar 2023","Jan 2023","Mar 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo","Mar 2023","Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Nov 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Oct 2022"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["A very beautiful temple.","Huge and beautiful","Beautiful and peaceful","Worth Visiting","An oasis of tranquility ","Loved the Kek Lok Si Temple","The lights on Chinese New Year are amazing!","If Disney did religion, but opened while they were still building it","Re-visit","Big Temple, Big Statue"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["This is the best temple to go to every CNY!!! They will have many beautiful lights hung up by then. There are many storeys in the temple. There are many statues of gods too! You will have to pay for the parking ticket. ","We went with our own transport (local bus) and got there early, which was nice, as it was getting crowded by the time we left.  Stunning huge temple with many levels.  Very calm and serene in places with views over towards Georgetown.  You pay to use the lifts (there seemed to be multiple, with one level transported by buggy) and you get a multipart ticket.  I suspect if you have a moped you can just go in at one of the levels but not definite about this.","Our guide made sure we visited both the top and bottom of this enormous Buddhist temple early in the day when there were few visitors and it was relatively protected from the heat.  It is dominated by a huge statue of the goddess of Mercy and a seven-tier pagoda.  Very beautiful with many photo opportunities.","I visited this Temple on January 2023 with my wife. So many places to take photos inside, good spot, worth visiting when you are in Penang, Malaysia.","I'm not Buddhist but you don't need to be to enjoy this place.  It's very quiet and calm so it's a nice escape from downtown Penang ","This wasn't on our agenda but a local person told us about it. We were so happy that we were able to visit this temple as it was amazing. So large and beautiful.","We came to see the celebrations of CNY this year and we were not disappointed. Visiting Kek Lok Si is always a pleasure, but even more at this time. You do not need the cable car, there are walkways and I would recommend taking them to get all the impressions. You should take your time to grasp the vibes of this beauty.","It looks okay from a distance, but once you're there, it goes downhill. The lower level is pleasant enough to walk around, then when you try to get further up, the only obvious route is the funicular railway for RM 16, return. Once you step off the first level, you're in an underground car park and there are no signs or staff. After a while a large golf buggy appeared, everyone jumps on, travels up the slope and gets dropped off at the entrance to the tackiest gift shop I've ever seen, it's large and you HAVE to walk through it to join the lengthy queue for the next level of railway.The place is also undergoing construction and it's difficult to tell what is being built and what has been abandoned. Also, because of this, parts of the site that are possibly worth visiting are not accessible.Once you arrive at the top, there are cars trying to drive through and park. I personally am atheist, but I often visit religious sites to appreciate the human endeavour and architecture.This place left me cold. It almost seemed cynical. There were visitors having roof tiles hand written with calligraphy for RM50 which were left outside one of the temples, I assume as a personal message or devotion. Around the corner were several hundred stacked up and about 100m away were 1000's more stacked with the calligraphy weathering off.I don't see how the scale of this site and the destruction of the habitat is justifiable for any benefit gained. Finally, it feels like the whole site has been built for car access only, a bit like a fast food drive through. When we decided to leave, the site was so busy that there were really lengthy queues for the funicular railway, again through the gift shop, that we decided to walk and then you truly realise that there is no provision for pedestrians.I went with an open mind and left with the feeling that this isn't how it should be.","Love this amazing grand monastery. The view from the pagoda and goddess of mercy  were impressive. Love this return visit. ","This temple is built on a hill and i think this may be the only temple which has 4 levels and you take a lift(like a tram) from level 1 to 2 and level 3 to 4.

My family name is Li (Lee) so I also visited Lee Jetty, but it‚Äôs actually only local houses and one food stall. You can try some fried banana, fried prawns with flour and a famous Big Bowl Noodles, those are tasty.","Although we have visited on previous holidays we trotted down the hot pier again taking in the views, this time taking the boat trip round the harbour.  Oh my days, I thought I was going to break a limb or worse climbing down the ladder into the boat, I'm not exactly nimble and wouldn't have attempted this had I not already paid up (it was quite expensive)  It was however good fun and a good opportunity to take photos. ","Prosperity is highly valued by Chinese so why not take advantage of tourists crowding on your doorstep. Clothes, souvenirs, ice cream and even short boat trips are offered on the second jetty.

The Blue Mansion was sold out but fortunately we were able to get in by 4p.m. for the last guided tour of the day.  Luckily our tour manager mentioned about this mansion. Our guide was so informative and detailed with the descriptions of each room he took us in despite all the noise and chatter from other guests.    Everything made sense on how and why things were done a particular way in a Peranakan household.  The most exquisite exhibit was in the Jewelry Room where the pieces of jewelry made from the kingfisher bird as the color blue was so vibrant.  There was a lot of explanation why certain furniture were built the way it was as the two chairs that are connected together so two people can face each other.  Our guide also explained the Baba Nyonya marriage preparations along with details of the wedding bedroom. The bright colors sure bought a lot of life in the items in this mansion.  They allow photos to be taken as long as it is without a flash.  Such a wonderful historical tour of a Peranakan mansion that is definitely worth to visit if you have a few hours here in Penang!  You can't miss it as it is painted a light mint green color!  ","It is beautiful, worth the price. Like the collections.  Missed the guided tour hours, a pity.  There are some other tour guides that focus on Instagram photo sessions for their clients.  This spoil the experience a little as they hog the beautiful place where u want to look.","We enjoyed the Pinang Peranakan Mansion (also referred to as the \"green mansion\" far more than we anticipated.  The 120-year-old mansion contains an amazing array of antique furniture, crystal, art, and collections of jewelry, embroidery, and more.  The entry fee of 25 ringgit for adults is well worth the price.  Be sure to join one of the tours (including in the entry fee) to get the most out of your visit.  We would have missed many interesting details if we had not joined the tour.  ","It is an interesting mansion. There are many rooms and the displays such as furniture, ornaments and clothing are beautiful.","An outstanding example of a Peranakan Mansion, the property is full of high quality furnishings, ceramics, glass and jewellery. It's also a stunningly designed building with many fascinating features. Don't miss it!","This was a really nice museum with very intricate design and items/furniture. It is mind-boggling to look at the opulence and how rich Peranakans used to live in the past. Must have taken lots of money and servants to maintain the entire place. I do think that some parts of the museum are over-curated - would be good to see some old preserved parts of the house instead. I am slightly taken aback by all the signs that say (in the tune of) \"once broken considered sold\". This makes it feel more like a shop than a museum. However, I think the overall experience was still pretty good. ","This was certainly an experience to see so many knick-knacks in a house. I felt like I was in a game where you search random objects in a room full of random objects lmao. As much as a 'museum' goes, I think you won't get the full experience if you explore the mansion alone. They have a guided tour, but I think it was only for group visitors. Somehow, I got a feeling the stuff there was for sale, because there was an antique shop at the back.

Please be respecful as this is a worshipping place.","Its a must visit for pictures and scenic beauty. It comes on the way to genting highlands from awana skyway station. It has pretty good area to walk and see and structure itself looks beautiful","Must visit! Very Beautiful and scenic ... big Buddha , GuanYin goddess and many others. Great place !","We got to the Temple after spending 4 hours in the Genting Highlands.  We were there during the wet season and had decided to stop here on our way back and hope for clearer conditions.  Which we got.There is a quite a lot to look at if you have the time.  We did everything in just over an hour.There is a huge stone Buddha which you can get photos from many different angles.We took the walk through the 10 Chambers of hell.  Quite graphic and confronting even though they are depicted as statues.  We enjoyed reading each station to learn about what type of behaviour wasn't excepted.My son had decided that there was an 11th Chamber of Hell after our time in Malaysia - \"This is for people who don't know how to stay on the left hand side of the elevators\"The Pagoda is 9 levels high and is worth the walk up.  The views were lovely and we gave a small donation when we were finished.There is the Goh Tong Hall which has toilets and a short walk up some stairs for views.The trip to and from the Skyway is quite steep but you don't have to walk as escalators take you there and back.","You can visit this place when you go uphill or down, since this is in the middle of two stations. Taking quite a long walk from the station to reach the temple itself, but elevators are provided. In my opinion, this place offers a lot of beautiful photo spots. This place is situated in a hill (CMIIW) and well, a lot of backgrounds to offer for your photo shoot."],"serializedRatings":["4.5 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Pahang","place":"Cameron Bharat Tea Estate","serializedDates":["Jan 2023","Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family","Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Jul 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Jun 2022","Jan 2022","Jan 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family","Mar 2021"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["A genuinely nice tour to the Cameron Highlands","Excellent guide Morgan","Overcharged Experience for viewing the tea leaves","Nothing great","Beautifull tea plantation","Beautiful to see","Great place for ATV and swing","Crowded but great view","Weekdays are nice ‚Ä¶","Cameron Valley Tea Estate"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["This is a full day tour to the Malaysian highlands. It is a part of the Malaysia that is 2000 meter above the sea-level that the Englishman used to go to in order to cool down during the colonial time. One example of the advantage of this coolness is that they can grow good strawberries just as us Swedes. Of course, a nice visit to a strawberry farm was included in the trip. However, the main attraction was the visit to a tea plantation (I am a very heavy tea drinker myself) and the sights of the landscape itself. There were also a stop at a waterfall, some butterflies and an Aboriginal man that showed a traditional house and.how to use a blowpipe. This was somewhat of a guy in the cage type show that did not give you a nice feeling. All in all it was a very nice tour with a very good driver/guide.","Do not miss this feats of colour and history We took the golf buggy down to the centre with Morgan our driver who had worked the plantation for 30 years. Morgan gave us such authentic insight into the tea process, the history and his own personal experience.What an asset. Please thanks Morgan for bringing the experience to life for us. Suggestion. Ask all your gollf drivers to share their Cameron Heights experiences and tell folks about the tea process. Thank you again!","Overated. The scones and tea are too expensive. RM32.00 for a pot of tea and 2 scones. And to view the tea plantation, there's  a charge of RM3.00 per pax. Getting too commercial.  Guests are spending money at the cafe which is a side attraction and they still sell their tea products.  Viewing the tea plantations should be free.","Visited Cameron valley in early December - it‚Äôs a nice place, they sell their own homemade masala powder and it‚Äôs so good. However, for the paid tour, we went with 3 above 65 paxs and apparently it‚Äôs supposed to be free for them but none of the staff informed us. We only found out about it after our tour on a very very small notice. Cameron valley should have it written when we purchase our tickets or make sure their staffs informs us! Also, the paid tour wasn‚Äôt so worth it - there‚Äôs just one cafe inside the tea plantation. It‚Äôs worth it if you just want to take photos and nothing else.","It's a beautifull tea plantation. Take the walk down to the picnic area (need a wristband - 3 RM) and skip the ride down (at least as you have the abbilty to hike up again) Smell the tea leaves and order a fesh cup of tea! ","Don't know if we are supposed to find this beautiful, but it sure was... Lovely to look out over, and to pay only RM3 to access the pathways amongst it. Really special little visit and a nice shop to purchase some reason... ","Nice place for an outing. ATV must be carried out by adult with a good control over bike if not you may fall off the cliff. The bird farm at the end of it was loved by the kids","Stopped at the Second Bharat Tea Shop (TS2).  It was quite crowded as holiday season, but did not have to wait long to order food ( cream tea). Scones and carrot cake were good.   Tea shop has a great panoramic view and for RM3 per person you can descend to the tea garden to walk some trails and visit various photo stops.","A must go during weekdays. Big no on weekends. I think they don‚Äôt serve their premium tea in their cafe despite the premium price","Its criminal to travel to Cameron Highlands and not try the tea that grows here. The whole region is generally known for its fine tea plantations but there are other agricultural products too and its fertile hilly terrain is lush green with fruit/vegetable farms, flower nurseries, crops, rare plants, rivers, waterfalls and tropical forests.And to enhance and take this refreshing experience even further, you have to choose one of many flavours of tea. I never knew there were so many varieties. There is standard morning/afternoon Earl Grey, black tea without milk, orange, strawberry, lemon, spice/masala, herbel, cinnamon, fruit and imperial premium tea as well as flower tea.And on the side locally prepared carrot cake, mango cheese, strawberry cake, Cameron Valley brownie, tuna filled croissants, pastries and so much more.

Would recommend him for our next visit","The place i very crowded and you walk on wooden paths to protest the most wood, around 600 meter long. Entry fee 30 RM.

This was probably the best way to travel up to mossy forest. Paid RM10 for entrance fee, and spent an hour there (not enough) and then the transport service picked me up to go down. Mysterious and mystical as always. ","The day we visited the forest was a misty, slightly drizzly day. I didn't mind it since I felt that the mist added to the experience, giving the forest an almost otherwordly feel. The only thing that irked me was that there were people crossing the fence and stepping on the moss despite signs telling people not to. But I suppose their Instagram picture is worth more than the million-year ecosystem that might potentially get damaged in the process.","Went there in Dez 2019.Wonderfull nature in its absolute pureness. We booked a guided tour, one stop was the mossy forest. You defintialy need to get good shoes and some cloths which can get wet and muddy, because the will definitely get wet and muddy :-)","Our guide, Mr. Ahmad was very accommodating and knowledgeable. Did the half day tour of Cameron Highlands covering the Boh tea plantation at Sungai Palas, Butterfly farm and an alternative hiking trail for the Mossy Forest hike. The original Mossy Forest trail was not accessible on our tour day due road construction works. The actual hike was approximately 500m each way and the highlands flora + fauna was amazing. All the moss and lichen makes it look like we are on the set of a sci-fi movie. The view of Gunung Brinchang at the top was breathtaking. Highly recommended activity in Cameron if you have not done it before.... Only moderate fitness required and not suitable for kids.","We visited the Mossy Forest as a part of a tour on Airbnb with a local guide by the name of Sathur who runs a tour company by the name of Cameron Secrets.  I would say place itself turned out to be average as we had great hopes. Also, while making our way there, the tour guide said that it was something like the movie Avatar, but frankly we did not find it so amazing. Maybe because we went on a bright sunshine day. This place might be better on a cloudy, misty day. Our tour guide was very good though and we enjoyed his passion and local knowledge. Must check out his tour on Airbnb or on TA.Ok, the concept of this place is that this forest is on the highest point in Cameron Highlands and is above the cloud line. Therefore, most of the times it is misty with clouds. And hence the forest has moss all over the trees and plants. And this has become a tourist point of great interest. Now the place is maintained by the local government and there are facilities like steps and wooden paths made specially for tourists so that you don't have to trample on the moss and destroy the natural phenomenon. It is said that moss once destroyed takes ages to regrow. So, this is a good thing. The government has made a nice wooden path with up and down steps for the tourists. The steps are equipped with wires so that you don't lose grip even on a wet, misty day. Our guide showed us a video of the forest during a misty day and it was really amazing. So, I feel this place will be better on a misty and cloudy day. That's when you would get the Avatar effect I guess. Some points to note:- you can cover this place in maximum 1 hour.- there is entry fee. RM 10 for adults, RM 5 for children (for locals). For foreigners, it is higher.- there are steps to climb up and down and can be a little challenging for children and elderly. But, the good point is that the path is not too long and more importantly there are points where you can rest in the resting huts with wooden benches. So, even if you get tired you can go up to a point and then start going back to the starting point. - it is advisable to wear good shoes. Also, advisable to carry caps, hats because on a sunny day, the sun can be quite overbearing. - you get to see all the plants and trees covered with bright green moss. You can click some nice photographs here in the lush green environment.- there is a viewing tower which you need to further climb up the stairs. But the view from there is beautiful on a bright day. That's the only advantage on a clear, bright day as you get to see the hills of Cameron Highlands and you can click some nice photographs on the top of this viewing tower. On a cloudy day, you will not get to see the hills faraway. - there are public toilets available at the entrance.- the necessary contact registration is done at the entrance to follow COVID SOPs. But, unfortunately there is no person in charge here. So, there is a electric thermometer provided with an register, but you do it voluntarily. So, many might even chose not to register and enter. There is nobody to check. - The road to the Mossy Forest is very narrow and is quite badly broken in some parts. So much so, that preferably you will need to be in a SUV if you want to make it there. This is surprising considering that this is such a tourist hot spot. One would have expected a good road to the forest. - Interestingly, when you go up into the wooden path in the Mossy Forest, the path is also the border between 2 Malaysian states - Perak and Pahang. So, you will see sign boards which point to Perak on one side and Pahang on the other side. So, overall an average experience but definitely a not to miss activity in Cameron Highlands. We did the tour which covered 2 points - Mossy Forest and the Boh Tea Estate. The whole tour took around 5 hours. Between the two, the Mossy Forest is a better place to visit as per our view.","Really enjoyed our walk through the Mossy Forest. Does exactly what it says on the tin... A forest covered in moss... But incredible to think how old it is. The walkways made it very accessible for me (recently had knee surgery) and a 4 year old. Definitely a must visit when in the Cameron Highlands. ","This is the 2nd time visiting this place together with my family and friends.I would say it is a must for everyone visiting Cameron Highlands to be here as the experience is spectacular as we climb the hill.We booked two Land Rovers from CS Travel to bring us here as they are very experienced and the tour guide is very friendly.Safety is paramount at all times.As we reached the top of the hill,found that it is even better this time as the management has completed the wooden trail to assist everyone to climb up and get down the hill safely.","I will start off by saying that I strongly recommend you book a tour with a local tour guide for two reasons. 1. They will most likely drive you up in a Land Rover or other such vehicle that will be well suited the winding, narrow road that leads up to the forest and 2. You will gain invaluable knowledge that the guide has cultivated over years.I booked my tour through Father's Guest House where I was staying and Raju was my tour guide. He was so knowledgeable and shared the names of most of the plants in English (UK and Canadian), Malay, and Chinese! He also shared lots of knowledge on the ecology of the forest and conservation as well.It is best to do this on a clear day otherwise you will be stuck in the clouds as that altitude is sometimes also known as cloud forest. But the views from the top are amazing and it is some good exercise to walk up and down all the stairs.","We went on a tour with Ecocameron, our guide was Balla. We were collected at 8.45am from The Cameron Highlands Resort and had a good 4  hour trip, with Boh plantation included. Great half day trip and enjoyed hearing about the various flora in the forest from Bala. The 4 wheel drive was in my opinion absolutely essential. DO NOT drive yourself as we saw a lot of cars in trouble. The road is terrible and it needs a 4-wheel drive and experienced driver to navigate.","Joined a day tour (with a 4x4).

The drive there was an experience and a half. Up a long winding road that is in desperate need of maintenance. My heart was literally in my throat at times. So large were some of the pot holes (crevices) and quite narrow for a two way road. Got to the forest around 3.30. Shuts at 4.30. Paid to get in and off we went. Sadly, due to covid most of it was shut but what we did see was beautiful. Only there ... 30 mins before we headed back.","It's my 2nd attempt to visit mossy forest.

You are charged MYR30 per person and can walk the boardwalk through the forest and see something very magical. Enjoy.","Very mystical, windy, cold and wet.  Can get dark as you are under a canopy of trees.  Reputed to be oldest in Malaysia surpassing Taman Negara because it was never explored due to it's rather scary dark nature.  That said, the kids loved it.  The site had a walk way wooden and can get slippery but the forestry department was smart enough to put steel nets to ensure that people do not trip. You have to pay RM10 for a Malaysian at the counter.  It is a short walk around but many were there for the lovely pictures.  In most cases you are surrounded by cloud so it has that effect of very cold. Young kids not encouraged ie babies.. you would have to carry them through the uneven steps can can trip. Old folks challenging as the steps up & down can be as high as two steps. All uneven. ","We drove up the mountain with great anticipation to get the view from the highest peak and see the mossy forest but were sorely disappointed when we got ¬æ of the way to find out that the road coming up had ruts 1ft deep (30 cm) and you could not go up without a 4x4.  Turning back on a 3m wide road when cars are in front and behind you trying to do the same thing was painful.  The local community should either put a sign saying \"do not enter if you don't have a 4x4\" or fix the road.  This was very disappointing.","We didn't have a 4 x 4 - just a regular car - and, with care, we were fine going up. The walk in the forest is only short (30 mins. roundtrip for anyone in reasonable shape), and there is a viewing tower to climb that gives wonderful views. Really glad we visited.","Be aware of the bad road leading up to it, we had to turn around half way up which was also a challenge because the street was so narrow with huge deep potholes (no warning signs beforehand).  Some parts were really only made for 4x4 vehicles unless you don‚Äôt care about your car and is prepared to end up with broken axles.  There was also no mirrors at sharp bends and it was so hard to see if any cars were coming around each bend. We backed down and managed to find a parked truck with a guide just metres down and after talking to him we managed to close on a great deal of paying him Rm20 per person to drive us right up to the entrance and back to our parked car.  The guide Fauzi was nice enough to wait for us when we told him that we only needed 2 hours of hiking time. The visit into the forest was a short hike within a small portion of the forest. Some parts required some climbing and the ground was a bit slippery due to the moisture and the rain the night before. But it was well worth the effort because we saw at close range some of the interesting plants and flowers that were there. Birds and butterflies flew above us while we toured the forest.  Remember to wear covered shoes and as you are bound to get mud on your shoes and don't go beyond the end of the wooden steps onto the dirt tracks into the forest. If you think you are able to hike..... you'll be sorry cos your feet will be in deep MUSH!","Lovely boardwalk with a viewing tower.  This is ideal for the whole family but totally unsuitable for wheel chairs and buggies!We saw wild monkeys. ","It‚Äòs a nice but very short jungle walking tour of about 250m.But you reach in center of itBe aware to use a 4WD to reach there - the road is hard to drivePay attention: location in Tripadvisor is wrong","I booked a 1 day tour with Cameron holiday tours. their program covers all the interesting sites.

I gained insights on the early history of Ipoh and the kind of life that workers at Tin mines led, very significant history. The guide was knowledgeable and the artefacts gave a good  picture of what life was like. Excellent!","There's a guide that will tell you the story behind the Hakka immigrants that help build Ipoh. You just need to book in advance. They accept donation (instead of telling to buy ticket) and I think it's worth it because it's such an interesting museum.","Found the museum to be a fascinating place. As someone with local Hakka heritage living abroad it was doubly interesting. Great guided tour, beautifully restored, highly recommend for everyone, tourists and locals alike.","HCPS stands out amidst numerous historical gems in the Old Town of Ipoh. The story of the museum is very unique, but it has also been beautifully restored back to its former glory, and feels like you're being transported back in time through the brilliant storytelling of the museum guide. It is incredible to me that this is a free experience (donations encouraged and pre-booked required) and I would say it is an unmissable stop if you're in Ipoh.","A lot of interesting facts about Hakkou tin history in Ipon. We were so surprised by the fact that one tin prospector's daily salary was 1 dollar, which could buy 100 meals under the price level back then! Totally beyond my husband and I's expectation.

The online booking process was very straightforwardand our guide was there to let us in ten or so minutes before our session was due to start. While the building is a former social club of a group of wealthy tin mine owners, it is also a great source of history of both the Hakka peoples in Ipoh and the development of the city of Ipoh itself. I found the tour fascinating and our guide to be very knowledgeable. Many of the items on display are very old and as well as explaining the tin mining process and the various groups of workers employed in the process, we learned about food preparation and storage. Upstairs in the gaming room was a fascinating display of how the club fostered gambling and accommodated ladies of ill repute. I found it  a very worthwhile experience and was more than happy to donate the suggested 10 MYR to go toward the upkeep of the amenities.","After visiting all the museums in Ipoh, I think this one is the best. The guided tour draws a complete and fascinating portrait of life in Perak through the epic tale of the tin industry. The volunteers who created this museum have done a remarkable job of collection, documentation and explanation. The guide is clear and knowledgeable. Don't forget : you must book online and arrive on time.","Very knowledgeable guide. Worth the 1 hour tour, entrance is free but I don‚Äôt mind purchasing a ticket because it‚Äôs that worth it!

Plus you have to book tour in advance and that was a problem with my schedule.But now at last I went there.A great visit. I loved it.Interesting for local and international tourists alike.To learn and have insight of local history, tin mining business and Hakka community.","The tour guide is very professional to include many interesting history stories. It definately worth a visit! Reserves in advance. Just my English listening is not good enough and hope the tour guide can slow down a little bit.","We visited  Hakka tin tycoon's club in Ipoh. Along with other ten vistiors, we were guided and instructed by a humorous gentleman. He is not only knowledgeable but also careful. When we stood too faraway, he would always paused to invite us to come closer. The pace and rapport was great.

The restored mansion is now a small museum on the city's history. The exhibition chronicles how Hakka tin miners from southern China worked in the field and gradually built Ipoh and Perak in general.

The guided tour was excellent - full of historical information, while also providing details of every day life. The guided tour is free, but donations are encouraged and well worth it. ","You need to book a guided tour online, which was fine and straightforward (we booked less than 24 hours in advance). The benefit of a guided tour is, of course, that you can ask your guide anything that pops into your head. Our guide was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the history of the Chinese community in Ipoh. (We were expecting a museum dedicated to tin mining, but that‚Äôs only a small part of it.) The downside to a guided tour, however, is that it tends to move relentlessly on just when you want to linger a bit. The displays are all very well labeled, but it is, of course, impossible to listen to the guide and read at the same time. It‚Äôs one or the other, and you can control how fast you read!Constructive feedback for the museum guides: perhaps try to better anticipate what questions the typical visitor arrives with. Example: What is tin? Why was it in great demand in the C19 and C20? How do you get it out of the ground? While all these questions were answered, the answers tended to be buried in a lot of rather impenetrable detail. We felt that we had to do a lot of the work ourselves to find answers. But that‚Äôs a fairly minor quibble. The tour is provided free of charge (donations encouraged, but there was no pressure) and there‚Äôs much of interest to learn. Definitely worth it.","The views are so amazing and we took a lot of great pictures.  And also understanding the Hakka root. It's great place to visit.","Good experience.

The visit to Han Chin Pet Soo greatly increased my understanding of the history. The tour is reasonably short, which is good, you get the key storylines.","This was a pre-booked free tour running at regular timings throughout the day for this building.

Night activities included the breathtaking luminous forest, a petting zoo, a tarantula cave, and a captivating fire show.The breakfast choices were limited, but the second day at Hippo Kingdom was fantastic, featuring sun bears, hyenas, and hippos. The flying fox is a must-try, and the 4D Dragon Slayer float ride is exhilarating!Don't forget to rent the double float for RM30 (deposit RM10).The haunted house is a RM10 charge and, unfortunately, not worth it.

Camps are comfortable and clean, as are the shared bathrooms.Staff are super friendly and accommodating and made the whole experience even better.  Kids loved the kayaking and evening activities, especially making Smores over the bbq pit.A big problem were the flies though. Apparently, it's a seasonal affair and they were everywhere. Super irritating.Though not a big problem, the bathrooms were a bit of a walk away from camps 7 & 8. A big help would be to at least have a wash basin at the reception area, which is also near where the bbq dinner was had. This would encourage clean hands for kids and adults alike without the trek to the bathrooms. Otherwise, everything was great. Did I mention the glamping staff? They were really the difference.

We went when it was raining, and it was really beautiful, especially since most people would go home at that time. Don't miss out the bicycles! It's worth renting the bicycles and cycling around the lake. *The bicycles become really cheap when it rains - the prices are lowered according to availability.","A visit to this place is a must. A great place for walks, and bird watching!Saw some Crested Serpent Eagles, lots of Long Tailed Parakeet, Kingfisher, Hornbill nesting, Egrets in abundance, Asian Brown Flycatcher, Pied Triller . . . and the list goes on","It is beautiful. It is big. And it is well maintained. In today's world of climate change, any green lung in a city which is maintained well is something which one needs to appreciate. Taiping Lake Gardens is huge and shares boundaries with Taiping Zoo on one side. It has lovely sidewalks and roads surrounding it. It has lush green landscaped grass, full of trees and lovely walking paths. Another big attraction are the many rainforest trees which have been there for many many years. You can see these trees everywhere. And some of them are propped up by metal supports which are quite amusing to see. Well to be frank we never went inside the park. We tried to during our first evening in Taiping, but just couldn't find the entrance. We kept walking around at an area which is called \"Raintree Walk\" which is a road adjacent to the lake where no vehicles are allowed. But, we just didn't know from where to enter. The next day during the day we went to the zoo and we saw many ways to enter the gardens. Basically the gardens are open from all sides, It is just that we were on the side of the gardens which had the lake in between, so we could not enter. So, my review will be restricted to the road named as \"Raintree Walk\". The best part about this area is that you can hire cycles on rent and ride the cycles on the road where there are no vehicles allowed. It is about a 2 kms stretch. The cycles on rent belong to a company called Cycledios which can be operated through an app. But, frankly we tried to operate through the app, and we couldn't. Later we found that there are people who are in charge who operate the bikes. There are 2 bike stands on either ends of this stretch. One stand remains manned till 9 pm. The other one closes in the evening. You can hire bikes for reasonable rents like RM 20-30 for an hour, though they are not very strict about the 1 hour duration. We went in the evening post dinner and we had a wonderful time. First we took a 3 seater bike for me, my wife and our 11 year old daughter. But, we found that it is quite daunting to ride a 3 seater bike. So, we quickly changed to individual one seater standard bikes and then we enjoyed thoroughly riding up and down this stretch for more than an hour. It was wonderful. The cycles are in good condition and you have 3 seaters, 2 seaters and single standard seater cycles. We were told by the people manning the stand that you can hire bicycles during the day and the you can ride inside the Lake Gardens too. Though we couldn't do it, I wish we could, but we didn't have the time as we were visiting from KL for only a 2 nights trip. But, this cycling experience was beautiful. If you enjoy cycling please don't miss it. Though there are no vehicles allowed on this stretch of the road, there are parking areas adjacent to this road. So, you can pretty much park anywhere and walk up to this stretch. Yes, to find a parking slot can be challenging in a weekend because of the huge rush. This place is visited by many who are just walking around on the road with no vehicles.","We usually went there on afternoon plan but we encountered bad weather, drizzle and somehow raining. So we decided to use umbrella for in case of those kind of weather. That location is near to our accommodation to Pearl Inn and we just had walking distance.And it is also near to Safari Park.","Had a wonderful bicycle experience there. The rent fees was cheap and definitely affordable. The scene was beautiful and the spot is considered clean.","A beautiful place to go with your partner, friends and family too. I'm sure that Taiping Lake Gardens is one of the well preserved and beautiful place in Malaysia. It's a best for a photoshoot and you guys can relieve your stress while enjoying the scenery around the lake. Don't miss out the place if you are planning to go to Taiping.","Taiping Lake Garden had beautiful scenery and good for those who love to take photos.

What more can you ask for?Definitely worth a trip!Our full review is on instagram (@monk3yseendo)","Taiping Lake Garden was originally a mine lake left over after the tin mine was exhausted.

The walkway is different that the one in Gua Tempurung. Gua Kelam's one scared me a bit because it was suspended and a bit shaky. Water runs under the walkway so try not to drop your camera when taking photos. The cave was well-lit but unfortunately, filled with graffiti.

Until I realised that they don't care about the cave. They were there for the river! To 'mandi sungai'.  From the cave, you will emerge at the \"secret garden\" where locals swim and have picnic (in and by the river). There is a trail going around the place. You can follow it and see the deer farm (looked deserted to me) and camping ground.

I'd suggest to arrive to the platform about 30 minutes before the start of the feeding, to avoid being in the back. I saw many orangutans up close, including a few walking past us. The feedings were different from each other. During the first, we managed to see a mother with her baby and during the second two orangutans (and, as always, lots of monkeys). The nursery was very interesting and, shortly before the closure, I also saw a very big orangutan there (I think he was an adult male).

Truth to be told, you always walk in the jungle and it is important to be careful when monkeys or even orangutans walk past you or approach you. It's mandatory to leave everything, except for phones, cameras and whatever you can fit in your pockets or very small bags, in the lockers (for free). This is to avoid the animals to get too close to you in order to grab your things. I think for the price it's a very beautiful centre, which does such an important work, and allows you to admire and learn more about these animals and to connect to the jungle. If you are in Sabah and especially if, like me, you have never seen orangutans in the wild before, don't skip it. ","Highlight of our trip seeing the orangutans. There are 2 feeding platforms to visit with a morning and afternoon feed for both areas. The first is a orangutan nursery where you will see a lot more whereas the second is an open where you can see orangutans and also seeing other types of monkeys. We were lucky enough to see a mother and baby orangutan on the boardwalk. It was 30RM per person entry and you can‚Äôt take bags or water in so free locker were provided.","We enjoyed visits to both the morning and afternoon sessions - the ticket covers both. This is a very special place. There was the chance to see the younger orangutans from behind glass - they were being fed in the nursery area. We then moved onto the main viewing platform in the open jungle where a huge orangutan came for a morning feed. It was busy, but you can take your time watching the oranguntans' (and monkeys) feeding and playing. We even got close up to 3 orangutans as we walked along the boardwalk area. There is a video that can be watched with more information and the chance to adopt an orangutan. There are free lockers for bags/ water as these cannot be taken in. Highly recommended.","Fabulous! Must do when in Sabah, and probably why a lot of people are there. You get to watch the young orangutangs from behind a glass wall as they are given morning tea. The hope is that eventually they are able to leave the centre and not come back for food. We then got to see older ones in the outdoors and finished up with a video. Wonderful way to spend the morning, be mindful that you cannot take anything other than a camera or phone, hat and glasses into the facility so spray, sunscreen and hydrate before you enter.","Fantastic! Wonderful experience. Busier than it was when I visited 23 years ago but this time we could observe the young orangutangs in the forest kindergarten more easily. Great value for money ","This was the most amazing experience that I will remember forever. I got to see the young orangutans in the nursery and then the older ones in the wild. I could have sat there watching them forever. Thank you for the experience","What a fabulous experience both seeing the young orangutan playing / training and then seeing the older (including a wild mother and baby) feeding twice in one day. Loved it.","It was wonderful to see the Orangutans in the wild, saw the young at their feeding times and the adults in the jungle. A unique experience to be so close to the animals who live in the rainforest  but can feed if they want to.We did this trip from Sandakan an used local driver Mr Farhan +601125322699 who picked us up at Sandakan Airport. He will take you to all the local attractions ....probiscus monkeys at Labuk bay, Sunbears  and Orangutans  at Sepilok, Naturepark and return to airport....Greatdriver and guide!We wish we had stayed longer so much to see with river cruises and jungle walks!","We visited as a group, and we enjoyed watching the feeding and the odd animal near us when we walked around the sanctuary. Facilities were good, we felt the experience was value for money. A must visit place especially if one doesn't meet the orangutan in the Kinabatangan river cruises.Seek out Eddie to provide excellent transport service. He treated us like family, brought us on the way to eat seafood and buy local fruit on the way to our destinations."],"serializedRatings":["4.5 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Sabah","place":"Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre","serializedDates":["Jul 2023 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jul 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jun 2023","Jun 2023","Jun 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jun 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jun 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Incredible experience","Simply Great","Love love love","Amazing - driver required","Amazing","Must Do!","Fantastic","Bucket list!

Thank goodness for this centre as they do fantastic work in rewilding these amazing creatures. We came for feeding time in the morning and afternoon and it was so nice to see the orangutans come down from the trees to eat and interact with each other. We were lucky enough to run in to one on the pathway which was a highlight although you have to be careful and of course respectful of their space. We loved seeing the baby orangutans being prepared for rewinding. Beautiful animals and a wonderful experience to see them up so close.","Of course, you have seen the centre on TV and we actually visited some 20 years ago. What they do here with the orangutans is fantastic in terms of rewilding. In the meantime you see a fair amount of them. The highlight for us was running unexpectedly into a mother-daughter combination right on the path. So worth the visit.","To be able to sit and watch these beautiful baby orangutans do their thing was a privilege. We were lucky enough to see the bigger animals come from the forest. Although the monkeys are a bit of a pest but it shows how the animals would interact in the forest.","We had a great time visiting the orangutans and the sunbears - definitely worth going! Would recommend getting there as it opens (or just before) because it can get busy pretty quickly and you want to see the rehabilitation center and the 10 am feeding.We are super grateful to Abdul the driver we hired (recommended by some of the comments) +60 11-1669 5114. Unless you have a car you kind of need a driver because Grab (like Uber) doesn't work well here. Abdul was fantastic and was the reason why visiting Sandakan was such a success - his food recommendations and his advice before we came were invaluable.I would highly recommend Abdul for his knowledge and price (I messaged a number of the numbers in other reviews and the other drivers were much more expensive)!","A real chance to see young orangutans up close. Be aware that you cannot handle them - they are being re-wilded, but feeding time was so entertaining and there were lovely walks on the jungle paths","We had the loveliest experience at the orangutang rehabilitation centre! It was extremely easy to arrange for tickets and our guide took us to the ‚ÄòOrangutang Nursery‚Äô which is a glass enclosed viewing space, that overlooks an area where orangoutangs in the process of being rehabilitated are fed. The room was open, airy, spotlessly clean with enough seating space for all. Next we went to the outdoor platform to see the feeding of the wild orangutang. Who  put on quite a show! The platforms are well designed and maintained and these is a lot of information on the Orangutang, their habitat and the program.  I definitely recommend you watch the movie at the end. A must do once in a lifetime experience.","Next to seeing them in the wild, this is it. I would say they are semi wild since they do know the feeding time. It is fun to see the naughty macaque monkey stealing their food. I applaud the work carried out here.","Seeing the Orangutans in Borneo has been on our bucket list for a very long time. We finally were able to make it to Sabah in May 2023 and the Sepilok Orangutan rehabilitation center was definately worth visiting. First, their mission to try to rehabilitate orphaned Orangutans and try to get them ready to go back into the rainforest is a very good mission. Second, we were able to see the Orangutans, up close but still in their natural environment. The were free to roam the forest and indeed some don't ever show up for feeding time because they learned to get all their food from the jungle. Totally worth a visit.","Great care taken to rehabilitate and save these majestic animals. Great views from feeding platforms morning and afternoons. Note that there is no physical barrier (guard rail only) so Orangutans can get onto the viewer boardwalks. The Alpha male is quite assertive and when we were there the guides had to push people back to keep our of his way. Doesn't appear to be aggressive, but he's a little bigger and faster than we are. For 30 MYR a head this is a great experience and nice to know the money goes towards rehabilitation, unlike the Proboscis monkey place,  which I suspect doesn't.","Visited during a full day tour of the Sunbears, Orangutan and Proboscis monkeys.Wasn‚Äôt sure if we‚Äôd see any as they do say it‚Äôs up to them if they want to visit the feeding platforms, we weren‚Äôt disappointed, first saw the young ones feeding and playing, then saw the oldest ones and the huge male come in for feeding time.

We managed to see some Orangutan in short distance while walking towards the platform. As suggested by our drive (Mr Eddy) we went for the first feeding in the morning who told us that we can use the same ticket in the afternoon.Make sure you have enough drink before going into the centre. You are not allowed to take with you any food or drinks. We also enjoyed watching the video show after the feeing. You can also go to the sun bear centre which is only apposite to orangutan centre.We hired  MrEddie for almost all the destination in Sandakan and on the second day he took us to Kinabatangan for a day trip river cruise. Very helpful,polite.Great gentleman! !!  Ca get him at whatsapp 00601171171178","We were staying only a few minutes away so we were able to visit the centre twice. We saw many Orangutan on both visits.It is well organised and is only open to the public during set feeding times. I found this very reassuring as I wasn‚Äôt completely sure how the centre was set up. I was keen that our visit did not contribute to distressing the Orangutan.I felt they have got the right balance. Visitors are essential in order to fund the centre but limited so as not to exploit the Orangutan.I was also unaware that the most of the centre is not enclosed and the Orangutan are completely free to come and go.There are two viewing areas accessed via boardwalks.The nursery has 2 seating areas and is behind glass with staggered seating. The larger seating area only has air conditioning. There are a few platforms with connecting ropes so the young Orangutan can practice their swinging in between eating. Very entertaining to watch!The outdoor viewing area is a large open area of decking facing a raised platform where they place food for the Orangutan to help themselves.At both feeding areas, the Orangutan showed no signs of being uncomfortable with the spectators. They were far more interested in the food!You are asked to wear a mask and can purchase one for 1RM. However, once inside no one wore them so it was a bit pointless. You are not allowed to take bags in with you but free lockers are provided.The restaurant was closed when we visited but there are toilets by the car park.The entrance fee of 30RM per adult is far too cheap and I would happily pay much more to contribute more to the valuable work done here.","Visited the center early of May this year after almost 3 yrs postponed.  We went to the orangutan first  feeding (suggested by our driver) and later to the sun bear sanctuary which is just next to the orangutan. Both are well maintained with a very helpfull and kind staff. Facilty such as locker room and toilet are fantastic except the cafe is yet to be open.  At 1.30 the same day we went to Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary whic is about 40 minutes drive from Sepulok. It was very nice to have seen the monkey from a short distance. As suggested by our driver, we went to see fireflies which is not in our plan. We were so thankfull to him for this experience. The next day we went to the turtle Island and spend overnight.Prior to arrival to Sandakan, I contacted a driver, Mr. Eddie via whatsapp (00601171171178) and email: borneowildnature@gmail.com who piick us up at the airport and took us to one of the hotel in Sepilok. He seems to have received many good comment and recomendations in Tripadvisor. Experience, helpfull, funny and soft spoken gentleman.","I really enjoyed visiting the sepilok orangutang centre. It was beautiful to see the orangutangs in the nursery section. The staff are doing an amazing job rehabilitating these youngsters. For the morning feeding session on the platform no orangutangs came so we returned in the afternoon and were privileged to see 2 individual mothers with their babies and another youngster. It was a beautiful sight to witness. These are wild animals so there is never a guarantee to see them at the outdoor platform. ","It‚Äôs important to know that visiting the Sepilok orphanage isn‚Äôt the only place that you can see Orangutans in Borneo. Prior to travelling to Borneo I think I thought this would be the only time we would see them. We had a wonderful visit from 2 orangutans to our lodge (My Nature Resort) the night before our visit to Sepilok. We also saw orangutans at each of the three other lodges we stayed at. Whilst there is no doubt that there they are plenty of Orangutans at the sanctuary and sightings are pretty much guaranteed it now feels that some of our best sightings on the trip were the truly wild ones. The sanctuary is busy with tourists but is well organised. We didn‚Äôt see the welcome talk , not sure why but our guide gave us some background. Definitely worth a visit but it wasn‚Äôt our holiday highlight. Don‚Äôt take any large bags with you or small ones as these need to be left in lockers at the entrance. Go in well hydrated if it‚Äôs a hot day as you can‚Äôt take your water in with you and some guests were leaving the feeding early to get back to their vehicles for water.","We visited Sandakan to experience  nature tour. I enjoyed watching endangered animals roam freely in their natural habitat, including observing a feeding session at the Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Center, seeing Sun Bear and visit Proboscis Monkey Sanctuary. The park was well maintained and clean. Public toilet is available and very comfortableüëçWe planned to spend only two nights in Sandakan, I contacted a private driver (Mr. Eddie) in advance to let him know the places I wanted to see and he pre-scheduled the appropriate tour content to ensure it will suit our timing. After the trip to Sepilok and the monkeys sanctuary we were taken to Sandakan town, food markets, and buffet lunches where only locals come. On the second day, Eddie pick us up from hotel at 12.30 pm and start our trip to Kinabatangan River for afternoon cruise. Boat cruise start at 4.00 pm sharp. Surprisingly and not to our expectation we saw a group of elephants  swimming cross the river. Proboscis monkey and other type of the monkeys, hornbil birds can also be seen along the river. We reached back our hotel around 8.30 pm. It was a long ride but surely a worth trip.The next morning Eddie toook us to the airport. We were able to experience things that we would not have been able to experience with other driver. Thanks to his careful guidance. The car he used is very new and clean. He told us he has a four wheel truck and a 6 seater Toyota Land Cruiser for bigger group.. And we know for sure he charged us way below the other driver who we contacted earlier. He can speak a very good English as he graduated from a well known university in Malaysia and worked in bank  before his retirement. We would definitely recommend him!This is his contact information:+60 117 117 1178borneowildnature@gmail.com","Had a really disappointing visit here - it had been one of the things we‚Äôd been most looking forward to on our trip to Borneo from the UK. We arrived at 2.45 for the 3pm feeding - but avoid this if you can if you want to enjoy your visit as the staff are really pushy and started hassling us to leave from about 3.45. Walked down the boardwalk back to the car at 3.50 with 5 members of staff following us step by step about 30cm behind which was no fun. We walked past an orangutan on the boardwalk and stopped when we were about 10m past him to let my 3-year-old take a look - and one of the staff actually physically pushed me with my son on my shoulders on the boardwalk because he said it was too late. Left with my son in tears. Such a shame as we‚Äôd come a long way to visit.","This place is absolutely incredible!! The orangutans are beautiful and it‚Äôs so special to see them being helped by people who are truly passionate about their rehabilitation. Highly highly recommend!!","Sipilok was a great experience. We were able to see many orangutans in more natural settings. The caretakers call out when the food is set out and the orangutans responds, coming down from trees or across the land. We were very fortunate to see an alpha male who seemed to be \"in charge\". The other orangutans seemed to let him eat first and kind of snuck around to get their share. Watched mom with baby coming down from tress and taking her food back up. Lots of viewing spots and can get some amazing photos. This is a special place in my view because they protect the animals while allowing them to live in their natural habitat. Wonderful experience. I feel so fortunate to have seen them. Saw gorillas in Rwanda and this was as exciting.","We had a fantastic experience here. If you are not on a time-limited tour be sure to go back for multiple feeding times as each will be a different experience. Be alert as we also encountered orangutans on the walkway, in the tree above the restrooms and along the path to the sun bears (we heard the sun bear centre was filled with orangutans the following day).While the main feeding time is widely listed as 10, there is an earlier one at the nursery, so 9 is a better time to arrive. Just be aware that the cafe mentioned as being at the site may not be open. It was closed on the days we visited and appeared to have been for some time. (I got the impression some families with young children had been counting on it). Unrefridgerated water is available for sale at the ticket office, but if you need to buy some, do so at the start, as the ticket office closes after the main entry times ahead of feedings. Also there is an extra (very small) ticket charge for any camera bigger than a mobile phone."],"serializedRatings":["4.5 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Sabah","place":"Desa Dairy Farm","serializedDates":["Aug 2023","Jul 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Nov 2022","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Apr 2023","Apr 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Feb 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Nov 2022","Aug 2022","Aug 2022 ‚Ä¢ Family"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Novel if you've not seen a  dairy before","Amazing view","Beautiful Gentle Cows, Magnificent View","Crowded but view is amazing","A must-go in Kundasang area, well worth the trip!","Moomoo cow @Kundasang, Sabah","Repeat after 10 years","Feeding baby cows were the best","Meh only ...","Good experience trip"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["The other reviews are accurate although there are more than 1 gelato machines.

Amazing view and there are lot of things to do for kids,  eg. Cow feeding, fresh yogurt etc. overall we love the place.","After consuming our light breakfast, we headed to Desa Dairy Farm, known as ‚ÄúThe Little New Zealand in Sabah.‚Äù Even before we arrived at the entrance, we marvelled at the huge 199 hectares of dairy farm filled with groups of Holstein Friesians cattle breed, the highest milk producer. We stopped by the roadside to take some photographs of the cows grazing in the fields.When we arrived at the entrance, we had to show our booking confirmation slip with QR Code to the guards before entering. The Entrance tickets at RM5.00 per person must be purchased online & ahead of time as Desa Dairy Farm does not accept walk-ins since there is a maximum limit of visitors per day & per session. There are 3 slots to choose from. Ours was at 8:00 am & valid for 3 hours. Even that, there were so many visitors already & we had trouble looking for parking. We didn‚Äôt know where to go as there were 2 huge buildings. We finally found our way to the main building after we saw the huge signage of ‚ÄúWelcome To Desa Dairy Farm.‚Äù Desa Dairy Farm is open daily from 8:00 am ‚Äì 5:00 pm. The Cow Barn is open from 9:00 am ‚Äì 2:00 pm. The milking session is from 2:00 pm ‚Äì 4:00 pm while the Milk Processing & Packaging Process is carried out from 8:00 am ‚Äì 10:00 am. The Agro Pen is open from 8:30 am ‚Äì 4:30 pm. This is where you can have the experience of feeding the cows with grass or milk which was the 1st place that we visited.The grass & milk bottle was sold at RM1.00 & RM1.50, respectively. I bought a set each for the 3 of us. We took turns feeding the cows & they let us pat them. It was such a beautiful experience. Feeling hungry, we went back to the main building to get some breakfast. There was a pizza kiosk & I bought a slice of Chicken pizza at RM4.00. I believe they have 3 flavours to choose from. My friend bought some chicken pie, croissants, yoghurt & Camembert cheese. I enjoyed all except for the Camembert cheese. There was a long queue at the Gelato ice-cream kiosk. I stood in line after finishing my meal. A cup of gelato was sold at RM6.50. If you want toppings, it‚Äôs RM1.50 each. Full from breakfast, my partner & friend explored the area while I stayed indoors looking at the milk packaging process. Although I‚Äôm lactose intolerant, I wanted to taste the fresh milk. I bought original fresh milk & Chocolate & Coffee flavoured milk. As for yoghurt, I chose the Strawberry & Passion Fruit flavour. Thereafter, I joined my partner & friend who were waiting for me outside.We walked about & enjoyed the cool air, beautiful scenery of the farm & appreciated the picturesque cows grazing in the fields. I would definitely come back again as we could not make it to the milking session & to buy more of their delicious fresh milk.    Desa Dairy Farm produces 900,000 litres of milk per year. It has been developed & promoted as an agro-tourism business which is sustainable & produces high-quality assorted local-made products such as fresh & flavoured milk, yoghurts, cheese & their famous Gelato ice-cream. It is a great destination for all.","Definitely a tourist spot. There were a lot of tourists, and it made the place crowded. However, the view is amazing. We spent 30 mins there, a short walkabout, fed the calves and a lot of picture taking. Quite hard to take a picture without other tourists in the frame. ","Worth the 2.5 hour trip, amazing scenery, well maintained farm with a lovely park next to it. Cow feeding was fun, the kids loved it! But be warned, especially during peak season or school/public holidays. It is swarmed with tourists and school kids, they come in bus loads! The farm facilities cannot accomodate the large crowds, i.e. toilets, sitting areas, cafeteria. Another highlight of the farm is their products. The queue for their Desa Gelato was so long, took us almost 1 hour since they have only 1 machine that churns out  a few cups at a time. Never have I queued that long for a iced dessert, but alas we wanted to try freshly made yogurt gelato straight from the farm. Taste was good, amount was subpar. Due to the bad queue, we ended up late to Poring Hotsprings and it was closed by the time we reached there. Disappointed, we headed back to the city, went to Suria Sabah Mall where we found out there's a Desa stall right in the mall's foodcourt..no queues, same taste, better cup serving! Felt so cheated with the loss of time queuing at the farm, if only we knew they have the same milk products in the city too, same gelato machine even. TIP: if the farm's gelato queue is too long, skip it! It's not worth it..just get it from the city's malls.. Note to Desa: Add more gelato machines to accomodate the crazy peak days queue.","Full of tourists when we visited the place. Got to taste their ice creams which I thought was very average, so I would say it was overated by other reviews. Environment was nice, kids got to enjoy calf feeding (either milk or grass).","Came here again after 10 years. A lot of changes from the entrance to the breeding area but the merchandise not many choices compare to 2013. Next time, I will overnight before continuing to Kota Kinabalu.","When we arrived it was foggy. They had cows grazing the fields. We tried the gelato, the chocolate flavour taste better. We also fed the calf. However there was a sick calf in the same pen as the other calf, they should have treated the calf and not left it there","We paid online for the tickets two weeks ago. We went at 11am (our time slot) and had they scanned the tickets on my phone. The person manning the booth informed that there were no milking session. This farm is a big place, however, there were no signages. We drove in,not knowing what to do. We parked at one parking lot and  headed to a building  (following other people's flow). We arrived at the counters selling gelato, milk and cheese. The gelato (without topping)  was RM 5. There were two flavors, original and chocolate. Both tasted so so only. We didn't buy milk and cheese.  I managed to take some photos of cows going back to their barn (from a far). After that, there was nothing much to do. The rainy weather didn't help much either. Can skip this if you have other things to do in Kundasang","It‚Äôs a good experience to visit if you stay at Kundasang. You have to go at the right time before the breast feeding time starts.

On a clear day, it offers great views of the Mountain as well as the lowlands of Kundasang.Also the ice cream is a must try while there.Have to online book your time slot to go and visit. Walk ins or drive ins are not allowed anymore. I guess it's to control the crowds as I've been there when there was no need to prior book and parking was a mess. Am sure that stressed the cows as well.","Interesting to have a cattle farm in the tropics. Pleasant and scenic, but don't expect to see many cattle roaming the pastures. Most of them are in functional concrete barns with only a few out in the slopes probably for \"show\" for visitors. Yoghurt was very good. Cheese and fresh milk were good although a lot less creamy than what you would find in NZ or Australia farms","The main draw ‚Ä¶ the cow feeding (with milk/straw) is closed due to the COVID situation (according to the sign posted) so the closest you get to the cow is along the road or at the restaurant, if the cows saunter near.We also missed the cow milking when we arranged at 8.40am. So we can only purchase the mill products, see the milk carton assembly line & enjoy the mountain scenery, together with throngs of tourists as this is probably a key item on their itinerary.","Time wasted here. There was a requirement to do online booking before heading to the farm. For those that are not aware, they have no option but to do the online booking on the spot before they can go in. It created a massive jam because there is only 1 entry point whether you did your online booking or not, you are required to queue together with those that need to do the online booking on the spot. You can imagine the number of cars, insufficient parking spots and no traffic controller. So you have to park far away and walk about 1km. There is no proper signage on where to go or activity guide. You just follow the crowd. You walked to the barn to discover no goats or cows in it. There is no activity for the day and people are not informed at all. If there is some signage on the website or at the entrance people would be able to make an informed decision about their visit to the farm. We are paying an entrance fee and wasting our time queuing for nothing. Imagine those with little ones and mobility difficulty.

You must clean your hands or sanitize them before and after touching the animals for your hygiene. I came on weekday so the place was not too crowded.

You'll see all kinds of sea creatures there: from small coral fish to Sharks even whales (don't expect a lot of macro though...) and you might be lucky to have an unusual encounter with some of the big ones! We were lucky enough to see a massive Leopard Shark. Unfortunately, apart from his awesome encounter, we didn't really see much more of anything. The usual White Tip shark hanging around, reef sharks, turtles, etc. Visibility wasn't as good as I thought, and I saw a lot of coral destroyed probably by heavy storms or I don't know.I would totally give 5 stars to Sipadan, but I also think is really overpriced and you will need to book more than a day if you are hoping to see outstanding.I know this helps to limit the number of divers there, but it seems like it is also a very profitable business and its quite disappointing if you spend a lot of money to go there and it doesn't reach your expectations.Anyway, it still is a must if you can afford it, and you should if you can.","After a boatride of almost an hour from Semporna, you reach this little gem with a stunning underwater world!!

Diving in August /September means the south point and other areas are closed off due to big waves and super strong current. Best time to dive is end March & April with clarity of 20m or so..I was fortunate to have a guide named Jali from Uncle Chang dive shop who knew the place at the back of his hand.. he would successfully locate the huge barracuda wall of fish at Barracuda point. Could spot the jack fish school from the boat even with big waves. And knew the timing of the tides and when the bumphead parrot fish school would appear. 2 out of 3 dives at sipadan with Jali was incredible. We would see black tip, white tip and reef sharks with turtles diving in and out accompanied with bumpheads and jack school at the same time.. it was awesome. The other dive with another DM wasn‚Äôt as successful as he was kinda new to sipadan.. kinda of a wasted effort and sometimes really bad clarity.. overall.. sipadan offers a lot.. a little expensive but worth at least 1x if not 2x or do what I do and dive 3x .. ","This time I refused from visiting Sipadan because the price in all the dive-centers became huge - 1200 ringgits for 1 person ($300) for 1 visit.It's just a robbery. Shame to Malaysian authorities. I came here with my daughter and could not show her the island.","Excellent didn't disappoint. Huge turtles, sharks, and groups of barracudas, jackfish and angelfishes. The corals are still good. Enjoyed the diving.","Sipadan was formed from an oceanic volcano at the bottom and basically has wall dives on all sides. It is like a giant aquarium where you get to see everything and anything that is happening underwater. Magnificent schools of fishes, clouds of jack, countless reef sharks moving around or laying in the sandy slopes, gigantic turtles, triggerfish chasing and attacking divers, trevallies hunting around. The fame of Barracuda point is indeed well deserved. And last but perhaps the best, while diving into the Blue at South Point, we saw a couple of hammerheads. One was gracious enough to circle our group a couple of times for us to marvel at its sight before it disappeared into the blue. We have done Komodo and we were mesmerized but Sipadan perhaps outranks Komodo. It is unlike anything we have ever seen before (though we are not very experienced).","As part of our stay with Scuba Junkie Mabul we had 1 day diving on Sipadan. This was a truly special experience despite there being poor visibility we saw soo much. It is magical to be able to dive with such large numbers of fish.  ","Since it is a national park one need to get permit to dive there. I got this by staying with Scuba Junkie Mabul resort for 5 nights  so that they can give you one day assured  (4 dives) in  Sipadan. Since It was peak time to much rush was there. We dived (total 7 divers from this resort max )  on 23 April 2019.  clear sky  we dived in South point and Barracuda point and Turtle patch and Mid reef. All are  ok compared to Mabul and Kalapai as good marine life (lot of turtle and sharks) and fishes.  We did saw few about 30 Barracuda in dive site but not the swrill. Also we dived in Barracuda point at low tide thinking that we get to see  Bumphead Parrot fish in numbers but we were disappointed. only one or two stray we could see. dives are morning  3 dives and after lunch 1 dives.But the facility of bath room and toilet pathetic, No water or loose /broken taps.  not justified for the permit money collected as not maintained properly.  Also  after seeing the bleached  corals in all sites  one could imagine the  destruction caused by global warming. At least  Govt restricted the divers number to protect from over exploitation. ","Lots of big  fish,  turtles.... Great visibility like Okinawa or Ogasawara of Japan.   I believe the necessity to limit the number of divers.

It's pretty decent diving by average standards,  but it's ridiculously overpriced and a huge hassle considering how mediocre it was. Completely not worth the trouble and cost considering other diving spots around SE Asia and elsewhere.First, the Sipadan permits themselves are in short supply which limits your diving to one day per 2-3 of staying in Semporna / Mabul. You'll be spending over $200 for a day of diving on Sipadan, with permits, surcharges, etc.The island itself is nice, but the diving is nowhere near as awesome as it's hyped up to be. IT's a nice pleasant wall/reef but on most days the best you'll get is a bunch of turles and some small reef sharks.  I got much better big-fish diving in Komodo / Nusa Penida, or somewhere like Maldives, at a much lower cost per day.Diving around Mabul / Kapalai is also nothing special. The south side of the islands are boring sloping coral with no big fish.  North side are decent macro / critter dives wherever they have artificial reefs, but it's nowhere like Lembeh / Anilao or even Tulamben. You're forced to spend 2-3 days diving these repetitive sites just to get a chance at Sipadan.  The alternative are some diving shops in Semporna which let you go to Sipadan almost every day, but then you're enduring a 4hr boat ride each day, and have to stay in the awful disgusting town of Semporna.In short, you'll get better of each style of diving just about everywhere else and cheaper. I saw barely any experienced divers, which was pretty telling.","Excuse my language but this place is probably the most dynamic places where I have scuba dived, and I've dived all over the world including the Kerama islands, Fiji, Tahiti, Bonaire, Ishigaki island, Tulum, Dominican Republic, Saint Lucia, Guadalupe, Okinawa, Cosumel, Guam, Saipan and all over Japan. Only a limited number of people can enter this protected island and thanks to that, the waters and wildlife are perfectly preserved.This place is dynamic because it's a place for all divers - macros, micros, and geologists. The corals and fish are as colorful as Fiji, the barracuda and sardine groups are larger than any place in the world, the water is prestine as Bonaire or Saipan, and the wild life is vibrant as Cosumel, Ishigaki, and Kerama.","Everyone  must check in with Park Services so know your passport number. Washroom was adequate, food is provided by the resort that takes you there. I was disappointed in the diving. The reefs seemed in poor condition and fairly lifeless. there were 1 or 2 turtles and a few barracuda but not the numbers I had been led to expect.","BARRACUDA POINT, MALAYSIASurrounded by 1,900-foot-deep canyons, Sipadan attracts its share of big fish, with Barracuda Point at its vortex. In addition to swarming hammerhead and leopard sharks, hundreds of razor-toothed barracuda circle in a hypnotic formation. Diving Sipadan: strong currents, steep walls and sea life in abundance.The name Sipadan is uttered with reverence by divers, and with good reason. The underwater topography of this tiny 40-acre island, 36km south of the Malaysian port of Semporna in the Celebes Sea, is immense. There are a dozen or so excellent dives off Sipadan and on any given day you can expect to see sharks, numerous green turtles, schools of jackfish and barracuda. If you‚Äôre particularly lucky, you may catch sight of the most elusive denizens of the deep: the island is one of the last strongholds of the scalloped hammerhead shark.A vast wall plunges 600m just a few metres from the shore, making for spectacular wall and drift dives, while the hundreds of coral species growing on top of the extinct volcanic cone that forms Sipadan are home to more than 3000 species of fish. These include larger pelagic species ‚Äì white-tip reef sharks and grey reef sharks ‚Äì as well as devil and eagle rays, and the strong currents that flow around the island attract large schools of barracuda, as well as occasional giant manta rays aDiving under Barracuda Point, Sipadannd whale sharks.Barracuda Point Diving under Barracuda Point, Sipadan One of the island‚Äôs best dives takes its name from the large school of chevron barracuda often seen here. It‚Äôs a wall dive that reaches a wide channel with strong currents flowing through it; the barracuda are often seen at one end of the channel and one of the highlights is holding on to a rock and watching this immense vortex of silver and teeth. You may also see reef sharks along the channel floor, as they‚Äôre drawn to strong currents, as well as sinuous ribbons of spotted garden and moray eels, colourful lion fish, octopuses and scorpion fish, while green turtles often hang out in the shallows.Drop-off and Turtle Cave Drop-off is just that ‚Äì just 5m from the shore, the bottom falls away to a sheer 600m drop. As you descend along the wall, you may spot turtles resting on ledges. The most exciting part of the dive is Turtle Cave, a giant cavern opening 20m down that leads into a vast cave. It takes its name from the turtles that swam into the cave, got lost and drowned ‚Äì whole skeletons were found resting on the bottom. You have to be properly certified to explore the cave, but even if you swim just a few metres in, you may spot its resident, solitary George, a giant barracuda that's over 2m long. You might also see a shark or three. A large school of jackfish tends to hang out near the cave, best seen as you‚Äôre ascending.West Ridge, Hanging Gardens, Lobster Lair and Staghorn CrestThe western half of Sipadan is where the drop-off is greatest. Drift dives here are usually done in the afternoon, when the sun illuminates the wall, with the currents carrying you towards South Point. On good days, visibility reaches 40m and you may see some of the resident scalloped hammerheads on plateaus over 60m down, as well as grey reef sharks. The Hanging Gardens is a particularly colourful section of the wall, with numerous overhangs, barrel sponges and gorgonian sea fans, with morays, angelfish, groupers and sweetlips lurking in the crevices. The narrow crevices at Lobster Lair hide shy lobsters; Staghorn Crest is a garden of staghorn corals in shallow water, where angelfish abound, and the soft corals at West Ridge attract snappers, sweetlips, the occasional napoleon wrasse and groupers.South Point South Point is at the opposite end of the island from Barracuda Point, and the strong currents here attract larger aquatic life ‚Äì schools of grey reef sharks, white-tips and the odd rare leopard shark, as well as eagle rays, devil rays, giant manta rays and turtles. There are plenty of reef fish here also, such as sweetlips, moorish idols, yellowback fusiliers and red-tooth triggerfish, and macro divers should watch out for porcelain crabs, anemone shrimp, bubble coral shrimp and leaf scorpion fish in the shallows. The shallows also attract large schools of giant parrotfish that come to feed on table corals.Coral Gardens, White-Tip Avenue, Mid-Reef, Turtle PatchThe dives on the east side of the island are best done when illuminated by the sun in the morning, and on good days you can let the currents carry you all the way from Turtle Patch towards Barracuda Point, passing the other three sites and spotting mantas, devil rays, giant tuna and pickhandle barracuda in the open water along the way. Mid-Reef is a popular gathering spot for green turtles and reef fish such as Moorish idols, cardinalfish, unicornfish and more. White-Tip Avenue is a favourite with white-tip reef sharks, while the corals and crevices shelter butterflyfish, emperor angelfish and scorpionfish. At Coral Gardens, in a shallow part on top of the wall, you can see pretty much every reef fish species in Sipadan‚Äôs waters ‚Äì fire gobies, yellowmask angelfish, coral trout, you name it.Practicalities Sipadan is part of a protected marine conservation area and only 120 people are allowed entry per day. Twelve diving operators are allocated Sipadan permits; if you have your heart set on diving here, arrange your permit several weeks in advance ‚Äì or up to six months in advance for peak season (July and August). All diving operators have representation in Semporna (reachable by bus from the nearest airport, in Tawau) and diving bases on the nearby island of Mabul; all offer packages that include accommodation, food and diving. Once you have chosen an operator, they‚Äôll whisk you off to Mabul by boat. If you can‚Äôt get a Sipadan permit, all is not lost: there are spectacular shore, reef and drift dives off Mabul, Kapalai and other islands in the Semporna Archipelago.Sipadan (Malay: Pulau Sipadan) is the only oceanic island in Malaysia, rising 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the seabed. It is located in the Celebes Sea off the east coast of Sabah, Malaysia. It was formed by living corals growing on top of an extinct volcanic cone that took thousands of years to develop. Sipadan is located at the heart of the Indo-Pacific basin, the centre of one of the richest marine habitats in the world. More than 400 species of fish and hundreds of coral species have been classified in this ecosystem. Sipadan Island was at the top of Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine Gold List for 'The Top Dive Destination in the World'. In fact it shared its top spot with 2 other destinations known for the diversity of their marine life ‚Äî the Gal√°pagos Islands and Truk in Micronesia.Frequently seen in the waters around Sipadan: green and hawksbill turtles[1] (which mate and nest there), enormous schools of barracuda in tornado-like formations as well as large schools of big-eye trevally, and bumphead parrotfish. Pelagic species such as manta rays, eagle rays, scalloped hammerhead sharks and whale sharks also visit Sipadan. A turtle tomb lies underneath the column of the island, formed by an underwater limestone cave with a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers that contain many skeletal remains of turtles that become lost and drown before finding the surface.[2] Visiting Sipadan Island requires a permit issued by Sabah Parks, a Sabah Government agency. There are a limited number of 120 permits available each day[3]","You have to see it once and you will never want to leave this place. It is probably one of the best diving I have done in my live. So go and check it out you won't regret it.","A bucket list for every diver. Diving at Sipadan is limited to 120 divers each day so you know the place won't be crowded and the marine life aplenty.

Those with a sharp eye would love the macro creatures residing on the corals.Amazing place.","You'll get tired of seeing turtles and sharks, awesome vis and always something going on; infinite schools of jacks and barracudas, humpheads parrot fishes and on and on... ","Very rough sea during the ride to the Sipadan Island, as storming in the morning.Very calm and dark blue ocean underneath, amazing huge barrel coral formation.Magnificent barracuda tornado and jack fishes schooling of 300 M in tailing.Wall dive with very rich marine life, coral, of course all the green and hawkbill turtles waiting for you! (I think at least 20+)  Enjoy the drifting and missed the humphead parrotfish schooling, and catch up with one napoleon wrasse, lovely.Long rash guard pants and DC check for the depth, as no reference check or follow your DM.Enjoy","I read some negative reviews before going here and now after going there I would say ignore them.  Either they went to the wrong places or they are over privileged peeps.  The dives are a safe 40 minutes before the safety stop and ascending,  I assume it is the Island rules.  The coral was very nice but the water is so alive you spend all your time looking around and toward the depths.  I saw grey sharks darting by, reef sharks feeding (see pic), schools of huge bump head parrot fish, barracuda, jack fish and a sprinkling of turtle and lion fish.  No complaints about the dive and I headed out there on a stormy day that cleared up nicely.  It should be murky waters in October but I think our luck was low tide and slack water which made the reef shallow and between 1.5 to 6 meters it was all action. At depth there were strong thermoclines and it was like the water had turned intomsilky coconut oil. Check my photos from the 3rd dive at low tide and slack water.If there is any reason not to go to Sipidan it is the trash in the water in the straight between Semporna and BumBum island.  The outboard engines pick up rubbish frequently and on every trip it requires stopping the boat to clear the rubbish.  Semporna is 3rd world and not very developed and it this takes a day or two to get used to it.  Its not a luxury location and I would not come here with a young (privileged) family but with adult children it would fine, it reallly depends on your sense of adventure and ability to tone down and blend in. I stayed in a place that cost 30usd per night.  ","After 6 years I am back again to the diving paradise üòç Tjisnis my 3rd Sipadan dive trip and still amaze by it. Years back on my first dive, I was shocked by a large school of Bumphead Parrotfish and awe by the Baracuddas tornado.This round I swam with school of Jack fish, turtles and sharks üòç Beautiful coral reefs, the deep blue, and even the current can make me fall in love with diving again, again and again ‚ù§"],"serializedRatings":["5.0 of 5 bubbles","2.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","3.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Sarawak","place":"Semenggoh Nature Reserve","serializedDates":["May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo","May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Apr 2023","Apr 2023 ‚Ä¢ Solo","Apr 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Worth the trip out of the city","Semenggoh Thrills ","An amazing ethical experience","We got lucky ...

Just about half an hour from the city center, this Orang Utan sanctuary does offer quite a bit of other activities besides the Orang Utan's themselves. They are free to roam about so catching a glimpse of them is not guaranteed -- especially during the fruiting months after the rainy season. As it is a sanctuary, visits are limited to two slots a day and actually, all you need is around 2-2.5hours including travel time. When there are more attractions on the walk-in, perhaps you can consider spending an extra hour.","Come early, not close to feeding times. This is not a zoo and the animals are not on schedule. Walked about 10 minutes to the feeding area/ platform, keep mobile on Silent mode and DO NOT open your bags to drink water or to snack. Anwar, the Big One, was not there but came down to the Electric Buggy station area. Everyone rushed over to see . It was quite an experience. Seeing is believing!","Purchasing a ticket in the morning means you can use this ticket for the afternoon feeding session as well. We came for the morning feeding session and were very lucky as we saw 7 orangutans, unfortunately excluding the king. Nevertheless it was an amazing experience. This place is very ethical and the orangutans are not forced whatsoever to do anything. They have the option to come and get the food given on the platforms but they don‚Äôt have to if they don‚Äôt want to. NB - Highly recommend getting the shuttle service as the walk to/from the entrance is a killer in the heat.","About 30 mins on Grab out of Kuching. 15 minute walk to feeding station, but electric buggy shuttle available. Saw 1 teenage male at feeding station for about 3 minutes ... Approx 30 meters away. Apparently a lot of food available in the forest at this time of the year so they don't always come to the feed station. However, on the walk back his mother was in a tree right on the edge of the path. The rangers were careful to keep people away, but she was within 10 feet and completely unperturbed by all the attention she was getting. She was still there after the rangers moved us all on.Visit is limited to 1.5 hours. Ranger on site to answer questions. Limited Grab avaiilabily to return (we were lucky). Bus leaves at 10.30 and 12 but very slow trip.","I can see the real orang utan but only 1.üòÇ The rest didnt come out though the ranger call out. Waited 1 hour but not able to see those fellas.Consolation is we saw a beautiful squirel stealing the bananas.","I came here for the sole purpose of seeing orang utans and I was not disappointed! I was so lucky to have finally witnessed nature's amazing wonders even when it was raining when I got here. This is also a great place for a little workout as you could walk all the way to the main feeding area or take the buggy ride if you feel like it. Overall, it was such a fascinating experience and I would love to visit here again.","Unforgettable experience. Weren't promised anything but we were lucky and saw a young adult and a mother carrying her baby. It was such an honor to hear the \"keeper\" call out through the forest for what were clearly creatures he had a strong bond with, despite being semi-wild. Would have happily stayed the full time slot but the kids and husband were struggling with the heat after climbing through the forest the last bit before the feeding area (as others have suggested, I would 100% recommend the buggy up the hill.Many thanks for a wonderful morning I will never forget","The nature reserve is fabulous.  It is most definitely a nature reserve and not a zoo.  Therefore you are not guaranteed to see any orangutans but going outside fruiting season your chances are much higher.  We were very lucky as the day before the group didn‚Äôt see any during the morning feed, however if you attend the morning feed and are unlucky you are plowed to come back in for the afternoon session.  It was a truly wonderful and moving experience.  We saw an adult male, a mother and her baby, two juveniles and the alpha male.  When you buy your ticket you can pay extra to take the electric buggy up to the feeding station.  I would recommend this as the hill is fairly steep and it was a hot day","Great experience near Kuching to see orangutans up close. The venue is only open for two 2-hour periods each day (a morning session, and then a 2-4p afternoon session), so be sure to time your trip properly and arrive what when it opens to ensure you don't miss the feeding, which starts about 30 minutes after they open each session. I hired a Grab and paid him to wait for me and bring me back to Kuching afterward. Also good to pre-register for the tickets to save time.","I thought they would never come. I didn't believe we would really see the orangutans. After 40 mins wait in heat and all adults standing, silently. They started arriving.  I felt tears on my face - these fascinating, intelligent animals, that have been so tormented and slaughtered by humans.

We opted to take the electric buggy which saved us a 25 minute uphill walk in the early morning heat it was a wise decision, because as soon as we got there, they let people down for the first feeding, which was about a five minute walk down the path. The Rangers made a good effort to call, the orangutans  a young adult showed  up and ate some of the offerings he put on a nice show. We were told that a adult and mother were back up in the parking lot and everyone quickly ran back up there to find a mother within 15 feet of the parking lot very calmly, watching and feeding on coconuts and bananas. She stayed there for so long that everyone got bored, taking pictures and selfies with us , a very calm and inquisitive orangutan mother and baby. It was a fantastic first experience and after a month in Borneo, we had a nothing close to the first experience we had here.Really amazing","Firstly the 4 star rating: The Orang-utans really deserve the full 5 stars, but the only reason I am holding off 1 star is the distance from the entrance to the feeding station (it‚Äôs over 2 km away, sure you can hire a buggy, at an extra cost and the distance is mostly uphill. In this heat it is energy sapping) A simple solution would be just to change guests the extra 5 ringgits (¬£1) because no one tells anyone how far the distance is and we were no different and indeed walked. It took us about 30 minutes Now to the positive bits and wow were there a lot, mother and baby, up close and being feed, older Orang-utans coming down through the trees, the knowledgeable rangers calling them and parting valuable information about each one and finally we were blessed with an appearance of the King himself and the wait was worth itPlease support this attraction as the Orang-utans who live here are mainly rescued, some were born here and it‚Äôs important this type of facility continues. We were proud to do our small bit and the rewards were memories that will stay with us, as pictures below show","If you are driving here yourself (and not following a tour bus), do consider adding on a ebuggy ticket. We came with three young kids and I cannot imagine hustling my kids up the long slope when the weather was so hot. The buggy brings to you a carpark ‚Äúnear‚Äù the main feeding area. The buggy driver told us it was ‚Äúone minute away‚Äù but I think he meant the entrance to the trail leading to the feeding area. We had to walk in a forested area, along an uneven path (muddy, thanks to the rain earlier that day) for 5 mins before reaching the platform. So grateful that three orang utans made an appearance and our trip wasn‚Äôt wasted. We were warned that it was fruits season, meaning food were plentiful and the orang utan might not appear to eat the offered food. Other things to note- this place only opens 4 hours a day -8 to 10am and 2-4pm.  We were told that they do not adhere strictly to the feeding times (9am/3pm) and it depends on when the orang utan decides to appear. Also, bring insect repellent and a fan/umbrella.","Beautiful reserve. Well maintained and the staff are warm and welcoming. If orangutan are seen, it is usually mothers and babies and males. Unexpectedly, even in the rain, the king of the orangutan group dropped from the trees and stayed with us for about a half hour. He is magnificent. ","Very good friendly and knowledgeable wardens . They try their best to ensure the tourists have a sighting of the orangutans . We were lucky , we saw and photographed 2 families of mother and child . The electric buggy is a must for senior citizens to avoid excessive walking and is not expensive","No sign of any orangutans during our visit ( during the fruiting season) but we enjoyed the walk to the feeding area amidst the tropical flora and fauna and the sounds of the birds and insects.  A park bus is available but I would recommend walking the mile, if you‚Äôre able.","We were lucky enough to see some orangutans even during fruiting season. Very lively explanation of the ranger. Putty the trails are no longer accessible, but understandable for safety reasons.","What a surprisingly delightful experience to see Orang Utans during the feeding time.And there were at least 3 large males right at the start of our 2pm feeding session! And the reserve rangers were professional and courteous.Good job! Kudos to this sanctuary.","Semenggok will always be a great place to experience semi-wild sightings of orang utans. Of that, there is no doubt. What peeves me of is the lackadaisical attitude of it's personnel.They seem to be uninterested in really calling the orang utans during feeding times, after 10 minutes or so, if none appear, they give up. They fail to understand that some folks come thousands of miles to see orang utans. We understand the fruiting season will have an impact but we don't see you trying your best to entice.They also don't really know how to milk, the present souvinir shops are apethic and pathetic. I do this as part of my daily jobs and it says a lot if local guides feel some letdown. Come on guys! Do a better job!","Super place to spend a couple of hours. There are no guarantees that any orangutans will turn up but we were very lucky to see a mother and baby as well as another adult and a juvenile. Simply stunning.The walk from the entrance to the feeding platforms takes about 20 minutes and is vey pleasant. Strangely, the bus back to town leaves at exactly the same time as feeding time ends. It is difficult to leave the orangutans to go catch a bus. Next one is at 12, so a long wait."],"serializedRatings":["4.5 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","4.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","2.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Sarawak","place":"Semenggoh Nature Reserve","serializedDates":["Oct 2022 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Sep 2022","Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Sep 2022","Sep 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Jul 2022","May 2022","Jan 2022","Dec 2021 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Nov 2021"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Bus ","Very memorable","Great experience","Unforgettable","Meet the orange-furred \"men of the jungle\"","Being there at feeding time gives a better view of how they live and socialise.","Fantastic experience","Happy to see them roam freely","Blessed Day","Very Good Project"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["There is now a free electronic bus 103 goes from kuching to the park.

We were lucky that the old orangutan was sitting very close to the fence, eating a bunch of bananas, & was quite happy to sit & pose for photos for ages.  It was fruiting season so we were lucky to see two other orangutans at two different feeding platforms.  They have made a great job of this Reserve - you still feel like you are seeing the animals in semi-wild, but you know they are cared for.","Going to Semanggoh Nature Reserve was my first experience to see orangut√°n in their natural habitat. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect going to a nature reserve. It was very touristy as they have two feeding times per day and only allow you to visit at those times. Suggest to arrive 30mins prior to the times advertised to be safe and arrive to the feeding area.We saw Annuar (a 24 yr old male) down on the feeding platform, who was very impressive with his large cheek pads and his long hair is gorgeous. Could easily pass for a shampoo commercial! And we saw a mother with two little ones up on the ropes. Wouldn‚Äôt been nice if everyone stayed quiet yet people kept talking which took away a little of the atmosphere, yet I was still happy with my first orangutan experience. Highly recommend if in Borneo.","An unforgettable experience. The staff was knowledgeable and eager to share their information with us. You could notice they really cared about the animals. We were very lucky to see some, as it was fruit season.","This is the world-famous place to meet the \"men of the jungle\". To see these animals live freely inside this protected forest reserve was amazing. Luck was on our side to see the whole family eating and swinging from the trees was simply fascinating. You always run the risk of not seeing anything so we were very fortunate to experience 'live theater\"","Since it was established in 1975-78, it has led to the establishment  of other ornag utang reserves and made Malaysians more aware of the value of such reserves.","Our second visit, and an even better experience. There are 2 feeding times 9-10am and 3-4pm for visits and these times are strictly observed by the rangers. On our visit there were two orangutans in the first area - so we got a very close up (but very well controlled - of the visitors - by the rangers. On going to the feeding area we saw a large male, several solo Orangutans and two females with babies - fabulous.The walk from the gate to the feeding area would be quite arduous for your average visitor, we hired a taxi (if you would like his details please message me) and he parked in the car park very close to the feeding area.Entrance price is MYR10 for foreigners - which in my humble opinion is too cheap for such an experience.A must do","Happy and lucky to see the Orang Utans during the jackfruits and durian season!Went there 18yrs ago see nothing and finally see the orang utans in the park!You cant get very near and touch them in this park but that is the right way to visit them!","We love the fact that is quite hard to see orang utan even in this santuary! It shows that they have enough food in the wild.Lovely place to look out for Orang utan during the set feeding time! We saw a mother and her child. Lovely day! They were fed with coconut and bananas. But i think the rangers there work very hard to call them back to feed them and so the visitors would not be dissapointed. But i think is unnecessary to overfed them! Nice to see them in the wild!","Visited the reserve with my husband and daughter. Place is quiet on a Tuesday morning.

Then there are the upper class dining choices, James Brooke restaurant & caf√© surrounded by the park garden. Or the Gloria Jean‚Äôs Cafe with a river view on the top floor, for cakes, pies & coffee. 5. As you stroll along the riverfront, you will see stalls selling Sarawak souvenirs, cake lapis, lekor stall ( lekor stall was swamped with customers waiting for their orders, when I was there.... must be delicious ). 6.

It would have truly shown what its interior and compound is like during James Brooke's Sarawak. Overall, the Penan peoples' short musical demo is very welcoming.

The village is in a poor condition with quite a few spaces closed for public. We arrived during lunch hour just to find out there is a lunch break and the museum staff are off. The place was more of a ghost town with dilapidated buildings. The public toilets were out of service and the only ones available didn‚Äôt provide toilet paper and there was no water in the taps to wash hands . For the entry  price of 95 rings (20 euros) the place is simply a rip off and the local authorities should be embarrassed for its poor maintenance . The village brings shame to the beautiful local culture and leaves very negative impression to the visitors, who spend money to learn about the Borneo heritage.","Let me start by saying that I always try and avoid the overly ‚Äútouristy‚Äù attractions where people are bused in by the coach load.  However, we really wanted to see the various home so thought we‚Äôd take the risk.  We opted to get a Grab from our hotel (cost $22 round trip) and when we got there it was not too busy, despite it being a Saturday.  The live show on its own is worth the entrance fee, it was so good.  The theatre is in a beautiful building with comfy seats and air conditioning so a nice reprieve from the hot humid temperatures outside.  The restaurant is ok, I think possibly we just ordered badly as other diners‚Äô food looked good.  However at $4 for two meals and a soft drink you can‚Äôt really complain.  The houses themselves are really interesting and most of them have guides in there to tell you about the buildings.  Some even cook snacks ( we had delicious tapioca cakes and crisps).  The only thing that could be improved would be to either have a guide in each room or some kind of literature to tell you about them.  Overall a very enjoyable trip","A living history museum focusing on bringing stories to life. The entrance fee includes the 45 minute live show in a nice air conditioned arena and this tells the stories through dance, humour and live music. The main attraction is of course walking around and seeing the various types of houses and listening to the people tell their stories. Involvement is encouraged and we did get involved.All staff are friendly, knowledgeable and keen to interact. We spent a very enjoyable 3.5 hours and learnt a lot. It was super hot when we visited so a top tip is to bring and drink lots of water and seek shade. Professionally run and free car parking","It was AMAZING! This truly is a living museum. The guides/staff are friendly and happy to provide you with information regarding the rich history and culture of multiple ethnic groups in Sarawak.

We didnt recieve any information what so ever about the different tribes and houses so we didnt learn a thing. The one positve thing was the friendly staff and also the dance show. But this place is not worth a visit, especially not when everything is closed and under maintenance. Do not understand what I paid for really.","After reading all the reviews, it seems to me that absolutely either the powers that b are helpless to do anything or simply, they don't care. I see small and slight improvements from time to time but it's very slow for an organisation that has raised entrance fees and while i like to think that it goes towards improving salaries, i seriously doubt it.I see the same old staff who have a tired insipid look about them. They just meander in whatever they do. Many houses also seem to be on permanent \"suspended\" repair and there is only 1-2 house staffed by folks who are too tired to care.Coming from a local, i am sorry to say, this place is indeed boring and tired.

Once we arrived, our idea of just ask for some information, and return to the village later in the afternoon, Anyway, we were told that ee were right on time for a show. Hence, we decided to buy our ticket and enter immediately. Anyway, the show was already almost finished. Why not to be more transparent? Looked like they just wanted to push us in. Furthermore, most of houses were under renovation: why wasn‚Äôt this transparently mentioned at the entrance?Secondly, the overall experience was much worst that the other cultural village I have been, in Sabah. As there was no guided tour, it was basically a walk across traditional houses (mostly under renovation), with very few explanations and learnings. Also, there were not many ‚Äúadditional experiences‚Äù, like seeing people cooking traditional food and so on.Thirdly, I felt unsafe while at the show theatre. One of the safety exits was locked (!!), and the stairs for leaving the theatre were very small, so that it took many minutes to leave the theatre. I wonder what would have happened in case of fire!If I have to choose, I will definitely prefer to visit the cultural village in Kota Kinabalu: although it is much smaller, I learnt much more there!","the Culture Village is a showcase of some of the different cultures in Malaysia, specifically Sarawak.  There are traditional houses, dances, and arts & crafts people can see.  Unfortunately there are no signs or audio guides so unless you take a guide with you, you are on your own.  With COVID a lot of the items are also not available to touch or play around but it is still a good 3-4 hour half day visit.  The price of the ticket is 50RM for non-Sarawakian, and 20RM for Sarawakian.  They do take credit card.","The best place to know the ethnics in Sarawak. You can learn their culture, their way of living and their home. There‚Äôs a cultural performance twice a day and it‚Äôs so amazing to watch it.","If you want to explore and know more about Sarawak's culture, you must go here. The entrance fees are quite expensive for non-student. You will able to attend cultural shows at the hall if you comes in right timing . Worth place to go!","Went with my daughter last weekend. It was quite an interesting experience to go into each of the seven houses that depict how the seven different ethnic tribes live. Although there wasn't a cultural show, there was a short presentation in each of the houses. The long single log stairs as scary but fun. Would like to go back when there are shows. I just wish they have one entry price for everyone.","Good day trip. Four solo travellers pooled together to hire a driver/guide to get us out to the Cultural Village.  Our guide was excellent and everyone was good humoured, we really enjoyed our day.

The villas come very well equipped and were a nice luxury area away from the hustle and bustle of the park.

We also only saw one rollercoaster. And not to mention the food!Complete BS - and I don‚Äôt know how any locals afford this. AVOID!!!","Terrible. I have lived in Asia for 13 years and thought I had seen some bum deals but this took the cake. Prices are top dollar compared to their parks - did not deliver. Got there at 10am to beat the crowds but not much opens until 11 or 12. The so called scream park has 4 rides - 2 of them are not operating which leaves the roller coaster (which didn't start until 2pm) and a very lame cup and saucer ride. The wave pool HAS NO WAVES!!!! By the time the water slides open, the lines are long forcing you to consider buying an express pass. Nothing has been upgraded for 30 years. This is an embarrassment","Fabulous 2D1N experience with the Lagoon Villas and the Sunway team with our family. The Glamping villas are very comfortable and the team were very accomodating. We had such a great time!","It‚Äôs expensive in but if you stay they full day you‚Äôll get value for money . No food and drink can be brought in . Tbh a bit silly you can‚Äôt bring in water . There‚Äôs lockers and loungers at beach area in front of wave pool . Had a great day on the slides . Pizza was good too . Park cleared out a bit around 4 pm so less queues on the rides .","After paying RM160 x 2 for my husband and I, we only managed to ride two rides(both slides) because the second slide(U-slide before the snake slide, attached picture) caused my husband a massive back muscle strain and myself a horrible scrub on my back. Luckily, for me the pain went a way after some minutes, but as for my husband who has a history of back injury, this slide caused that pain to re-emerge after 20 years. We have never had such issues with any other theme parks. Even the first slide we tried here was fine! However, the second one, we were in a two-person tube, as we hit the bottom the floor scrapped through so hard. What I noticed later was that that floor of the slide lacked water and was flat so as to stop the tube. Although we were positioned by the guard at the top in a \"correct\" position, as we slid down, our positions naturally switched and it was all too fast. There was the first jump which was fine, and the second one was where we hit the floor(where we got hit) swung forward and back again. There were no warnings, no precautionary advice, nothing! My husband had to receive care from the first aid there and we had to leave immediately and go to a clinic. The first aid guy was really helfup and friendly thankfully.Safety is horrible here and the ticket price is awfully high for the crap they offer! The beach water was filled with what looked like plasters. The toilets were disgusting. Even the beach cabanas had to be rented at a price. What are we paying for then?? Please pass on the express passes !! No use as most of the rides didnt cater to them. Gosh and the animals...esp the otters! There were four of them and 3 were divided from the 1. The 1 fellow looked so sad and depressed...it kept trying to find a way to the other 3 and kept going in circles from land to water in the same motion. The other 3 kept by each other hugging and looking so depressed. Damn sad!! Paying a price to get hurt, to see the hurt and to swim in the dirt! How else to put this horrible experience!","Bought tickets on line...about ¬£75  for two.Arrived at approximately 11am ...que system not organised and to be told the Lagoon Beach was closed and also the parks rollercoaster.To be fair I would say only a few rides were running nothing of any excitement!!Visited the animals and found them in small enclosures and to be honest I didn't feel the need for large animals to be used for tourism unless part of a verified breeding program!!We didn't even go to the water park as a British female would have felt out of place in a bikini or swimsuit!!We spent about three hours walking around trying to find something to do....hence we left early.By the way you have to pay for the inflatables needed for one of the water slides!!!My opinion....give it a miss!!!"],"serializedRatings":["4.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","2.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","5.0 of 5 bubbles","1.0 of 5 bubbles","2.0 of 5 bubbles"]},{"state":"Selangor","place":"Sunway Lagoon","serializedDates":["May 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Couples","Mar 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Dec 2022","Jan 2023 ‚Ä¢ Family","Dec 2022 ‚Ä¢ Friends","Nov 2022","Dec 2022"],"serializedReviewsTitle":["Great day out using klook multi pass","Nice day out","Fun and excitement, complete happiness!","Theme park, water park, zoo","Why we loved CAMP OUT","Not worth it","A great hotel to stay in KL","Sunway lagoon the best","Best Day Ever","Great experience"],"serializedReviewsDetails":["Very cool place to visit. My kids and husband had so much fun. Lots to do and very good atmosphere. Statues of elephants and the way they have put themes around the park was really well done. Took a Grab from Mandarin KLCC. Very easy to catch a ride there. There was a lightning storm for an hour. All the pools were closed and everyone told to get under cover. We were lucky as we hired a Cabana but was very impressed how they safely cleared the pools and kept an eye on those sneaky patrons. All in all was a great day. Brought tickets from Klook and express passes. It wasn‚Äôt too busy but saved our NZ butts from standing in the heat any longer than we needed too as temps were hot for us. Cons- a few rides weren‚Äôt working when we got there. Which is a bummer. Otherwise great day","Nice place but you need to put stuff in lockers so think strategically where you store your stuff so you don't have to go the whole way round the park to get it.We were very unfortunate that it was very heavy rain and most stuff got shut so it was kind of a waste. But I expect on a nice day it would be brilliant. And next to a mall so another way to waste time.","We enjoyed all the parks! Staff were great service!  Complete with fun and excitement! May come back again! Hope to expect more rides next time!","Disappointed in our experience here. Billed as multiple parks in one, it failed to deliver on any of them adequately. The Wildlife areas provided grossly inadequate size enclosures for the animals. There was generally inadequate signage for patrons on directions and closed areas. WildWest smelled of sewerage, and clearly had effluent towing across pathways as workers cleared a presumably blocked sewer. I would estimate 30% of the advertised attractions were closed. Be forewarned; the park opens at 10am, the roller coasters at 2pm and ‚Äúthe worlds largest Surf Pool‚Äù has waves only between 430-630pm on weekdays (which was not advertised elsewhere). We still had an enjoyable day, but the lack of clarity with attractions and times prior to attending was frustrating and based on this we wouldn‚Äôt return.","OUR CAMP OUT EXPERIENCE Given the size of Sunway Lagoon (6 zones, 2 waterparks, Wildlife Park, huge wave pool, etc) you really need more than 1 day to see and do everything! We tried their new feature called Camp Out where you are staying in a tent INSIDE the park after closing time. We absolutely loved every minute of it and here is why:üëâ Being inside the park after closing time meant that we were the only ones there (besides a few workers). This is such a unique opportunity to explore the park! üëâ On the second day you have the benefit of being the first in line for that one attraction you really love but can have huge waiting lines. We both did the Flying Fox zipline first thing in the morning and were the first ones! This can save you so much valuable time.üëâ Camp Out is a private area inside zone Lost Lagoon. This means that you have a place to keep your stuff, take some rest and recharge with free tea and coffee and shower when you like. No need for a Cabana or Locker rental with this one. They provide free towels and toiletries too. üëâ Breakfast and the Hotplate Dinner that‚Äôs included were amazing!üëâAlso, the buggy service taking you from and to Camp Out was a nice bonus and saved us some walking. üëâ Mr. Alex and the whole SL Team made us feel so special, it really is a unique experience and our 5yo couldn‚Äôt believe his eyes when he saw where we would sleep that night! We will remember this one for a lifetime‚Ä¶ ü•π","I have no been back to Sunway Lagoon park since I was 12, I am now 30 and decided to take my 3 year old here. Not much has changed, everything seemed to still be as I recalled almost 20 years ago. Most food shops there were either closed or didn't have the full menu available.There was only 1 photographer at the park, taking shots of people going down the water slide. We decided to ask him if he could snap a quick picture of us before we left for memories. He wasn't really interested and after 20 mins of waiting at the photo kiosk, 90% of the pictures were blurry!There were 3 males mending the kiosk, my husband and I was talking and joking around with them whilst waiting for them to print out 1 picture. Now this is when it got interesting; I never ever give anyone my card for payment, I will always insert or tap on the eftpos machine myself. However this guy asked for the card in my hand but looking that the kiosk isnt that big and I can keep an eye on my card I gave it to him. After the payment went through he decided to hold on to my card and go 'somewhere' with it. I stopped him and asked where he's going. He said... \"get the receipt\". There was a receipt right there in front of him coming out of the eftpos machine. I told him off and told him to give back my card immediately. Left the park with a sour experience. The amount we paid (RM600+) was not worth what was available during that time!","Clean and spacious rooms. Great service by the hotel staff. A special shout out to Xin Yu for upgrading our room and accommodating to our request.","The best themepark ever i've go. Keeping the environment clean. Reasonable ticket prices with various activities. Many facilities are available. Very suitable for holidays with family and friends. I will go again.","Sunway Lagoon sells the tagline 'Best Day Ever' and do they live up to it or what. Its one of the best waterparks in south east Asia with plenty of rides for all ages and heights. While there are 6 different zones in the park the centerpiece is the Water Park  followed by the Lost Lagoon. If you enter from the main entrance, there is the Amusement Park and the Scream Park on each side. Both these parks have average rides which you can start with before you change into your swimsuits and get wet. The Wildlife Park can be avoided unless you have done everything else that there is to be done - even the animal show was poor. The water rides are spread across two sections - the main Water Park and the Nickelodeon based Lost Lagoon. Both have plenty of rides to suit all ages and thrill appetites. These sections are on two opposite sides of the  theme park. We took a locker (paid facility) at the start of the Water Park (washrooms are nearby for changing) after completing the  Amusement Park and Scream Park rides. After changing we did all the rides in the Water Park, had lunch all wet, did the rides at the Lost Lagoon and came back to the Water Park main pool for the evening wave pool. We started from the Water Park because we expected waiting lines and the rides we most wanted to do were in this section. But if the crowd is less it might be better to start from the Lost Lagoon and then end with the Water Park and the wave pool which is not to be missed at any cost. If you go on a non-holiday weekday then  no need for an express pass. My 7 year old (below 1.2 m) was able to do all rides he was eligible for - and even ended up doing the ones he enjoyed twice and thrice. Plenty of food options including Indian and vegetarian. The bag checking at the entry was not very strict and we managed to sneak in some cold drinks, gums and candies.        A special shout out to the support staff. My child cut his toe while exiting one of the rides and the staff immediately did his first aid much to our relief.Things to note1. Its a cashless park. So at the very start you need to get a band and load cash into it to pay for food, drinks, shops etc2. Lockers are paid for and come with a band as well3. The wave pool starts its waves almost half an hour after the slated time. before that its just a DJ blaring music and constantly asking 'Are you ready'. So better to not waste time waiting here.4. The waterproof covers for mobiles are expensive inside so better to buy beforehand if you have access.","Entrance ticket booked online through Klook and exchange for wristband in counter before enter the park. We are fortunate enough as all parks are operate on the day we visited. 1 day definitely not enough to go around whole park. Best to come for 2 days if time allowed.

Staying in Sunway Lagoon in a highly modern camp in the man made jungle with real fire BBQ as dinner. A good idea and well executed. The staff were awesome right from the entrance till the next day when you leave. Shout out to Mr Alex and Omar. They were always around to answer to our needs and questions. Kudos. Besides that there are few things that need improvements(since its new) but overall a very satisfying stay. Will definitely re-book again.","We bought our tickets through Trip.com and had an overall great experience. The check in process was smooth. Note that if you don't have the confirmation printed, they will physically take your phone in the booth as there are no QR codes to scan. This was a little odd for me since they took it instead of just looking through the glass.Fun theme park for anyone that is over 1.1m. Note the Hippo Valley area, my 4 year old couldn't ride on because for some reason he was not 1.1m for their measuring sign, but for ALL the other ones, he was?? The people there running that area were surprisingly rude. We were able to go on rides multiple times because there was not really any lines. We focused all our attention on the water park rides/areas. Heads up - Nickelodeon lagoon is not more kid friendly than the other side. You still have to be the same height requirement. We didn't try the wave pool or the rides.There are a lot of food options that are branded, so the food is better than in most theme parks. The prices are affordable. There were pretty much no lines when we were there. The beach areas were nice. If we had more time and more people with us we would rent a cabana. The lockers were easy to use and accessible. Note a few things...1. Some rides/slides are closed.2. Some rides you HAVE to have at least 3 people for. This makes it difficult for a couple/2 people.3. Some rides you can ONLY have pairs. This makes it difficult for a family of 5.Overall we would go again on a day when there is school to insure no wait time.","Welcome to Malaysia - as a foreigner we‚Äôll make you welcome by charging more than the locals! Then when you enter the park, we won‚Äôt tell you that there is a cashless system in operation until you get to the farthest away part of the park and have to walk back to the entrance to buy the special wrist band, which if course will be non- refundable if you don‚Äôt spend your value, but don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôll be able to spend it on the overpriced, poor quality fast food available throughout the park. As well as paying the foreigner premium you can spend some more money to skip the queues.","Glad that they allowed infant rides with parent. Some of the rides can be extreme and some activities required additional charges. Since you will be putting away your valuable item beside your mobile phone, therefore they allowed payment via QR code (Maybank) except for small stall which still prefer cash payment.","The entrance fee is very high and acceptable considering there are 6 parks. However it was a disappointing trip as most of the amusement park rides are closed. We went on a Friday. Felt cheated. Ended up playing just the waterpark. So it's unfair to pay the full rate when we ended up with the waterpark alone. We should at least be informed that most rides are closed due to whatever reason before we purchased the tickets and find out later. Since most of the amusement park and scream park rides were closed, there were more people just riding the waterpark rides. Those who purchased the express lane deserved the express wait. However, the operator shd know how to managed the line. Ended up, some rides had to wait a very long time. Especially the flying fox. Shd be at least 3 to 1 or something. Its bad as every express lane get to go a couple of times before it's  regular lane. It's very obvious.Had a bad experience. Disappointing.","I bought 4x pax express pass for Sunway Lagoon on the 26/8/22 but did not see that the date was set on the same (it was suppose to be for 3/9/22).  I called the contact +1347 897 0100  in the next 5 minutes to change the tickets date but he said can only refund 50% via credit.  I have to buy another 4 tickets after that!","Sadly, expensive and disappointing. No waves in the wave pool which was shut from 2:30 p.m. anyway. Many of the attractions are shut. It's all a bit expensive for what it is. There was a 1-hour wait for the main water park ride, the vuvuzela, and you are constantly being overtaken in the queue by people who have an express pass which incidentally is only available to Malaysians. I certainly won't come here again and if you haven't been I would save your time and money and go somewhere else. By the way, if you are female you will feel very much out of place in the waterpark unless you are wearing full length body covering including hijab.","I went on 1.8.2022 with my son and I bought the Quack Express tickets.We felt cheated because more than half of the exciting rides and animal exhibits were not open and the signboards claimed that they were closed for upgrading. However there are no signs of any upgrading works being carried out and it appears to me that these rides have been in decrepit condition for a long time and I guess due to the pandemic MCO/lockdown. This means that the park ought not to be opened or at least this fact that more than half the activities are not available should be publicised and made known to the public. We felt cheated and it is disgraceful. Can you imagine the disappointment when we found out that all the roller-coaster rides were not open. The so called largest surf pool was the largest dud as it was not operational. In the X park, the catapult was closed. It is also useless to buy the Quack Express Pass because it can only be used for two slides and the Vuvuzela at the Water Park. At all the other queues, the attendants don't care about  the Quack Express Pass and we were made to queue up just the same as those with normal passes.The management of the park ought to be ashamed ","Really not worth the trip. Long ques, many rides not operating or operating at low capacity, few staff, and grossly overpriced. We had prepaid tickets and still had to que for 40 mins to get inn. The day we went, not all rides were open, and those who were had long ques. Once we went to the water park did we find out that the exiting rides had ques up to an hour and many activities only opened late in the day. The changing room was nicely said \"dirty\" and if you need a locker for your family's belongings it will set you back another RM 50. Malaysian food are generally excellent as long as you don't have it at Sunway Lagoon. Best description for the food here is \"meh\"","DON'T BUY QUACK XPRESS!!Its useless. The only queue worth it is in vuvuzela game and also they will ask u you to wait if u r only 3 pax until they find another 2 xpress more ppl. Others without quack xpress will be before u!Also one staff brought normal visitors 9 pax 2 rids! before us just to have social media pictures & vedios! Other game not that much crowded specially in working days and quack xpress line will be at the entrance only which has no queue at all. At the top u have to wait with others long time because its 1 line only to start the game. Don't buy quack xpress for ur kids 4yrs if they are 105cm or less. They are not allowed to enter most of the games even with parents!! If its not all the games as well! I used to sit with my son in kids playing area most of the day cz of that.

","Lived up to all all the hype in terms of stay and views. However..the snorkelling could be better...and taken to more interesting locations with actual live corals.","Redang Island is a beautiful holiday destination for nature-lovers, diving enthusiasts, avid snorkelers, sun-seekers, beach-goers and anyone who wishes to take a break from their hectic working life and enjoy a change of scenery.","Redang is a great base to take snorkel and dive tours. The island gets a bit crowded around the resorts. ","Great for clear sea swimming, snorklying with turtles and exotic fish, diving and boat trips. At night walks on the beach are perfect for star gazing.","On a clear sunny day, the beach and the colours of the sea are beautiful. One significant criticism is the tractor and trolley-in-tow service that carries tourists up and down the beach from the road to their hotels. And it's all day. Completely spoils the peace and relaxation and parents have to watch their children relentlessly. Alongside the idyllic footprints in the sand are huge tractor tyre prints. Another shock was the amount of people there on Saturday and Sunday and Monday - the beaches are too small for the sizes of the resorts and hotels now, so the first days of our visit were no fun whatsoever - it was like being in a shopping mall and it was the opposite of island paradise. It was a touristic nightmare. The weekdays were beautiful when everybody had gone home. The snorkelling - the main purpose of our stay - did not disappoint and we saw turtles, reef sharks and beautiful fish without even having to take a tour.","This island is very beautiful. A lot of activities are provided here which makes the people occupy their time rather than just swimming. So safe.","run from the hectic life from city to Redang island. It will be a best place for us running into nature!There are a variety of water activities are available: divingbeautiful and clean beach!please waiting for Sunset view!!!!!","The beach is amazing, white sand and amazing colour of the water.

What's special with Redang Island? - well, here comes a list :)- some of the most beautiful beaches on earth with clean white sand- crystal clear seawater - no pollution in the sea- a hand full of very good hotels, we stay at the same every time- the locals/ residents are friendly, the younger generation speaking very good english- it's a very safe island, no crime- there is a police- and a fire dept stations- all the hotels have bay watch and the staff is looking after all their guests- there are first aid stations and there is a doctor office on the islandWhat we are doing:- swimming, snorkling, kiting, boat tours/renting, relaxing in the resort, visit the village - have a visit and snorkling in the Marine Park -  there is also a golf course - guidet jungel trekking, guidet snorkling tours by boat to the Coral reefs-  bird, wild animals watching, - fishing  - ok, thats enough for a week :)( our last visit was some years ago)","A very peaceful and beautiful must go island. A lot of restaurants and bars in the front of the beach so you can really enjoy your food and drinks on the beach however it is a bit pricey ","You know about those wallpaper white tropical beaches with palm trees and totally NOT crowded? Bonus: the best snorkeling ever, the island is surrounded by shallow water multi color alive corals, and filled with colorful marine life, an absolute snorkeling joy.Best tip: go during the Ramadan period, there will be no local tourists, only some tourists from China (we went end of May 2018) You can do jungle trekking, snorkeling, scuba diving, giant turtle sanctuary visit, marine natural park visit. Just don't expect super fancy luxury accommodation in Redang, hotels are decent, but that's it. Still the highlight is the lack of crowds that you see in Thailand's famous islands for example, and that's a rarity these days, if you get lucky you can have the beach only for you... :)","The island boasts some of the best beaches in South East Asia. Water is crystal clear and warm, the sand is white and mostly clean and the island itself offers great places to snorkel or dive. The beaches itself make the island worth visiting. However, there are two major drawbacks. First, its quite a hassle to get to and around on the island. Either you take a 1.5h public ferry or get a speedboat pickup from your resort (costly, not sure about the time saving). On the island itself there is no public transportation. As the island is very small, it lacks proper infrastructure in general so you are pretty much stuck with the resort you are staying at (except for a few restaurants as a cheaper alternative to the expensive on-site options). Second drawback is the lackluster quality of the resorts given the prices that are being charged. If you are there primarily for beach and water activities and do not care too much about your accommodation, then this island is highly recommended.Tip: Before booking an activity with your resort, try checking with any of the local restaurants. Pretty much all of them offer the same activity for a lower price.","This was my 2nd visit to Redang island, and it was still an awesome place to go for a dip. Crystal clear water, white sandy beach and what else to complain? However, there are certain area have too many people, try to avoid that area if you want to have a relaxing and enjoy the moment. Bring along your families, relax and enjoy the sunrise, swimming with fishes. However, save the coral, people will damage those beautiful corals, try to limit number of guests or visitors.","Never been to Redang before and my first visit there was to celebrate our 2nd marriage anniversary. We chose to stay in Taaras Resort and it was one heck of an amazing and unforgettable experience! The only thing I regretted much was not spending more time there. 4 days were definitely not enough! Looking forward to going back there soon! üòç","I've seen my portion of islands throughout asia. Mostly snorkling trips. While comparing pulau's such as Tioman, Gili, Rawa or Amed to Redang, I must say the marine life at Redang is the most beautiful one. Never have I seen sea turtles as large  as here, nor fishes as diverse, colourful and big. On the downside the coral is trampled and bleached. There's also a lack of activities on the island, aside from snorkling and diving. Since there isn't much choice, the prices at the resort are times 5 higher than in the city. You'd expect great quality and service, but most of the cases it disappoints.","We visited for our honeymoon and it was incredible. I can't recommend this any more highly.

The last time I was here some years ago, the corals are teeming with life. They are not in a very good state due to recent bad weather, but there are still fishes to be seen. The wild corals in snorkelling spots seem to do a bit better. Other than that, Redang Island is a budget island destination for families and friends, due to the abundance of fullboard packages offered by the resort. Couples will have to seek better resorts like Laguna and Berjaya for a honeymoon vibe. Best budget island to learn how to snorkel; the sea is relatively calm and nice to swim in!","This is my first ever trip to a proper island, with my hubs for a break. We opted to stay there for 3days 2nights. Journey there from shahbandar jetty was smooth and on time, comfortable boat ride complete with air cond for around an hour +. We arrived around mid day, the water is super clear. You can see the bottom of the sea from the boat, super sunny but not so windy. For the 3days we spent time snorkelling, eating and chilling just around the beach (30weeks pregnant so i did not join the snorkelling trip to the marine park) but snokelling around the area were beautiful enough. However...sadly the corals are dying, no vibrant colours from the corals. There were tons of dead corals on the beach, luckily there were many colour fishes around the reefs. My husband said it is so much different from his last trip there 3years ago, corals were still alive and none were seen on the beach. But overall, a very nice experience and a good break from the city life. Definitely recommended!","Stayed at the Redang Island Resort, think its a 4-star unsure? nice resort, nice beach. Not a so cosy lounge area but nice nough to sit outside at the bar","1 of the best island in malaysia, beautiful beach and plenty of beautiful coral. Cristal clear water with nice white sandy beach. ","Spent 10 days on this amazing Island with beautiful rainforest and clear blue water. The snorkeling is lovely with a rich variety of fishes, sharks and of course the big turtles.

The sand stretched far out, under the sea water as well. The sand gently sloped into the sea, making the beach here very suitable for swimming and water activities.
