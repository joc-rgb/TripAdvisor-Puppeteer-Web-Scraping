# TripAdvisor Web Scraping

This project aims to scrape data from [TripAdvisor](tripadvisor.com) for sentiment analysis purposes.

## Introduction
In this project, we utilize web scraping techniques to extract data from [TripAdvisor](tripadvisor.com), focusing on customer reviews of various tourism attractions in Malaysia. The extracted data serves as the foundation for sentiment analysis, enabling us to gain insights into the opinions and emotions conveyed within these reviews.

## Background
Tourism is a significant industry for Malaysia, with its diverse cultural heritage, natural landscapes, and modern attractions attracting millions of visitors each year. Understanding the sentiments expressed by tourists in their reviews can provide valuable insights for tourism stakeholders, including attraction operators, tourism boards, and policymakers.

However, one of the significant challenges in sentiment analysis research and applications is the limited availability of open-source data. This scarcity hinders the development and testing of sentiment analysis models and tools. To address this issue, this project was created to collect data from [TripAdvisor](tripadvisor.com), a popular platform where users share their experiences and opinions about tourism attractions.

By scraping data from TripAdvisor, we aim to build a dataset that can be used by researchers, developers, and enthusiasts for sentiment analysis tasks. This dataset not only provides valuable insights into the sentiments of travelers visiting Malaysian attractions but also contributes to the advancement of sentiment analysis research in general.
